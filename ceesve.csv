0,Ancient Polar Mythologies,"Nowadays and for the past five centuries, since the introduction of the heliocentric globe deception, all world maps and explorers have depicted and described the North Pole and surrounding region as being nothing but an arbitrary point in a semi-frozen tundra.  Previous to this however, depictions and descriptions of the North Pole and surrounding regions in world maps and ancient explorers' accounts were very different.  Firstly, before the 16th century, the North Pole was never once shown or thought to be just some random, ambiguous point amidst a low salinity Arctic Ocean as it is now.  Instead, the North Pole was universally described and depicted, from diverse cultures all across the Earth, as being a gigantic magnetic mountain situated directly below Polaris.  The prevailing belief was that compass needles the world over were actually pointing to a huge ""loadstone mountain"" made of magnetite at the Pole; in contrast to today's prevailing belief that compass needles are pointing to some constantly moving magnetic field generated by hypothetical molten metal existing at the center of a fantastical globe-Earth.  While neither claim can be confirmed or denied without independent exploration and experimentation, it should be noted that nowhere in nature can we find molten metal which retains any significant magnetic properties once heated past the ""Curie Point,"" let alone create some convoluted constantly moving di-polar field as is claimed by proponents of the fantasy ball-Earth. Ancient Buddhist, Vedic and Jain traditional cosmologies all state that at the North Pole magnetic center-point of Earth exists a circular mountain of magnetite called Mount Meru.  Puranic and Sumerian traditions also referred to this place calling it ""Mount Sumeru.""  In Ancient Iran they spoke of Mount Hara Berezaiti with a celestial spring on its highest peak in the realm of the stars.  In early Chinese writings there is Mount Kunlun with a bronze Pillar of Heaven at the summit where the immortals dwell, often also called ""The Pearl Mountain,"" a paradise home of four great rivers around which the heavens revolve.  The Turkmen tribes of Southern Turkestan told of a copper pillar that marks the “Navel of the Earth.”  The Mongols wrote of Mount Sumber with the Zambu tree on its summit.  The Buryats of Siberia talked of Mount Sumur with the North Polestar fastened to its summit.  The Siberian Dalmucks spoke of a mountain lake from which four rivers flow to the points of the compass.  The Egyptians wrote of the “Mound of the First Time” which was the first land to appear from the waters and is the dwelling place of the High God, the source of light.  The Muslims wrote of Qaf and Zoroastrians wrote of Girnagar, the world encircling mountains.  The Navajos spoke of “encircled mountain” which was surrounded by four directional mountains.  The Dogon tribe of Nigeria told of a cosmic pillar spanning 14 worlds which was the “roof-post of the house of the high god Amma.”  The Warao Indians of the Orinoco Delta in Venezuela speak of a cosmic axis extending above the center of their earth disk.  Ancient Greek mythology referred to ""Mount Olympus, the Home of the gods.""  The ancient Germans told of “Irminsul” a universal column which sustains everything.  The Norse Edda spoke of ""Asgard,"" the burgh of the gods rising in the center of ""Midgard,"" the circular earth.  Ptolemy recounted a legend involving magnetic islands which exerted such strong attraction that ships with metal nails were held in place and unable to leave.  In the Arabic legend, ""One Thousand and One Nights,"" a magnetic mountain pulls all the nails right out of their ship causing it to fall apart and sink.  The second tallest mountain in Tanzania is even named ""Mount Meru"" after its primordial partner at the Pole. ""In many traditions, the world mountain is identified symbolically with some local mountain.  This is illustrated by Mount Olympus of the Greeks, Mount Alborz of the Iranians, and Mount Khun-Lun of the Chinese.  In Near Eastern tradition, the world mountain is the small hill in Jerusalem known as Mount Zion.  Thus the circular continent centered on Jerusalem in medieval maps also possessed a symbolic world mountain.""  -Richard L. Thompson, “The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana” (146) “Jerusalem was Paul’s lodestone.  The ancient mariners who set sail in their little cockleshell boats tended to hug the coastline, not daring to get too far from land.  Aids to navigation were few, and their vessels were at the mercy of wind and wave.  The slightest sign of a storm would send them scurrying for refuge.  Moreover, the dreams of those old-time venturers were haunted by thoughts of the fabled, ‘lodestone mountain.’  They believed it had the power to draw their vessels to shipwreck on its shores against all the pull of tide and wind.”  -John Phillips, “Exploring (the Book of) Acts” (402) Isaiah wrote about a mountain, set above all other mountains, in the far recesses of the North where the gods meet called Mount Zion in Jerusalem.  Genesis, Ezekiel and Enoch all mention a paradisiacal Eden, the mountain of God, and source of four main rivers.  Genesis 2: 10-14 reads: “And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.  The name of the first is Pison: that is which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.  And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.  And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.  And the fourth river is Euphrates."" Mohammed also spoke of four rivers and a divine tree.  In the Srimad Bhagavatam four branches of the celestial Ganges flow out from Brahmapuri on top of Mount Sumeru. In ancient Canaan, Guri’ili, the mountain of El, was the dwelling of El, the creator, and a place of assembly for the demi-gods.  In one Phoenician ivory carving from around 1000 B.C., a deity is shown dressed to represent a mountain with four streams coming out from the mountain-god-man at right angles.  Similarly, in an ancient Akkadian hymn to the goddess Ishtar, she is addressed as ""the Queen of the Mountain of the World and Queen of the land of the four rivers of Erech,"" and she says, ""I am lord of the steep mountains, which tremble whilst their summits reach to the firmament."" In the Christian apocryphal book of Enoch, Enoch is taken by angels on a tour of the seven heavens and while in the third heaven shown magnificent trees producing wonderful fruits with adjacent springs pumping honey, milk, oil and wine to four directional rivers flowing down into paradisiacal Eden, an abode specially prepared only for the pious and selfless.  Similarly, in the Hindu cosmology, four trees in Ilavrta-varsa stand on great mountains producing rivers of nectar and honey, like fountains of youth, providing health and vitality to all who drink of them, while the central tallest ""Jambu"" tree rises to incredible heights and ""seems to cover all the heavens."" ""In the Bhagavata Purana Mount Sumeru is surrounded by four great mountains surmounted by four gigantic trees.  These include the Jambu tree after which Jambudvipa is named.  Four huge lakes of milk, honey, sugarcane juice and pure water are located between the four mountains, and these lakes confer mystic powers on the celestial beings who bathe in them.  There are also four celestial gardens near these lakes.  From the foot of each of the four trees, there flows a river that either emerges from the tree itself or from the fruits of the tree.  These rivers of honey and different kinds of juice flow throughout the region of Ilavrta-varsa surrounding Mount Sumeru, and they confer freedom from fatigue, disease, and old age on the inhabitants of that region.""  -Richard L. Thompson, “The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana” (132) The Yakut people of northeastern Siberia have their own strikingly similar ancient myth where a world tree of immeasurable age exists ""at the navel of the Earth,"" just like the Hindu Jambu tree is ""born of the umbilical knot of Brahma.""  The Yakut world tree reaches into the high heavens with cones nine fathoms long and sap which imparts youthfulness on all who consume it.  Near the Yakut tree also lies a lake of sweet milk, which is where the popular modern Japanese milk company ""Yakult"" doubtless gets its inspiration. ""In different traditions, the upper and lower worlds may be divided into several levels (often seven or nine).  In the center of the earth-disk there is a world mountain or world pillar that links middle earth to the lower and upper worlds.  The world mountain represents the polar axis, and the dwellings of great demigods are located on its summit.  The world mountain may be surrounded by other mountains that define the cardinal directions, and these directions may be associated with certain colors.  Four sacred rivers may also flow from the world mountain in the four cardinal directions.  There is a world tree that is often situated on the world mountain (or four world trees may be located on the neighboring directional mountains).  The world tree extends from the earth to the heavens, and it is nearly immortal.  It is the source of rivers of nectar or pure water that give health and longevity to those who drink them.  The tree stands in an earthly paradise where there are celestial gardens and rivers of various substances, such as milk, oil, and honey.  The tree or world pillar is often associated with a great eagle-like bird that is the enemy of great serpents dwelling in the lower world."" -Richard L. Thompson, “The Cosmology of the Bhagavata Purana” (135) In ancient Iranian thought, a mountain called ""Hara Berezaiti,"" or ""Albordj"" stands at the center of the Earth, a fixed point around which the Sun, Moon, and stars revolve.  At its summit lies the dwelling place of ""Ormuzd"" the lord of light, complete with a giant miraculous tree, an Edenic ""garden of Ahuramazda,"" and the celestial fountain ""Arduisur,"" which is the mother of all Earthly water and flows down towards four cardinal points into four large streams.  The bridge ""Tschinevad"" reaches from the peak of Albordj to the solid vault of heaven, or ""Gorodman,"" the home of the pious and blessed, whilst underneath lies the great gulf of Duzahk, the abysmal abode of the lord of darkness, ""Ahriman."" The earliest cosmogony recorded by the Japanese in their most ancient book, the Koji-ki, once again mirrors this recurring mythology.  In the beginning, Izanagi and Izanani, the great god and goddess standing in heaven drove a celestial spear into the endless sea and twisted it around until an island rose from the water.  They then descended from heaven to Earth and built a palace around the huge spear using it as the central pillar.  This spear became the central axis of the world and their palace the birthplace of the human race.  In the Koji-ki and Shinto religion, the Creator and the North Pole are so purposely and inseparably linked that one of the often used names of God translates to: The Lord of the Center of Heaven.  The ""Ainos,"" supposed first inhabitants of Japan, whose name means ""offspring of the centered,"" are believed to have arrived onto the archipelago ""from the North,"" and bury their dead facing North to where their ancestors came and to which their spirits would return. In Buddhist funeral ceremonies bodies are cremated in special crematoriums actually called ""Meru"" which are essentially tall stone pillars with four doors at the peak aligned to the cardinal directions, with the belief that our reincarnated souls will pass Mount Meru before returning to earthly bodies.  Literally every temple and the little spirit house shrines found in most Buddhist homes are also representations of Meru, the abode of the gods, aligned to the four cardinal directions, and opulently embellished with gold, jewelry and metaphysical artwork. ""Koeppen assures us that 'every orthodoxly constructed Buddhist temple either is, or contains, a symbolical representation of the divine regions of Meru, and of the heaven of the gods, saints, and Buddha’s, rising above it.'  Lillie says, 'The thirteen pyramidal layers at the top of every temple in Nepal represent the thirteen unchangeable heavens of Amitabha.' Faber develops the evidence of this practice among the ancients with great fullness, and with respect to the Hindus and Buddhists says, 'each pagoda, each pyramid, each montiform high-place is invariably esteemed to be a copy of the holy hill Meru.'""  -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (229-30) Ancient South American traditions also believed the human race was birthed in the farthest North, upon the highest of mountains, surrounded by perpetual clouds, fountainhead of the world's waters, and home of god Tlaloc, residing on their sacred paradise mountain Tlapallan.  The first man, Quetzalcoatl, was said to have drank the water of immortality from Tlaloc's mountain and ruled as king throughout a golden age in Mexico.  The many Incan, Mayan, Aztec and other step-pyramids and temples aligned to cardinal directions and devoted to the gods are representative of this world mountain.  Interestingly enough, many modern Mexican myths now represent the mountain as crooked or partly turned over. Similarly, in the ancient Chinese Taoist tradition, a myth over 4000 years old refers to Shang-te, the highest of all gods who lives in ""Tsze-wei,"" described as ""a celestial space above the North Pole.""  Shang-te's abode is said to exist directly over the peak of Mount Kunlun, which again places the ""highest god"" at Polaris.  As with the other cosmologies, Mount Kunlun is a primeval paradise, abode of the gods, with a world tree in the middle, and a fountain of immortality from which four rivers flow outwards to the four corners of the Earth. ""Sparkling fountains and purling streams contain the far-famed ambrosia.  One may there rest on flowery carpeted swards, listening to the melodious warbling of birds, or feasting upon the delicious fruits, at once fragrant and luscious, which hang from the branches of the luxuriant groves.  Whatever there is beautiful in landscape or grand in nature may also be found there in the highest state of perfection.  All is charming, all enchanting, and whilst nature smiles the company of genii delights the ravished visitor.  Where now, is this Paradise Mountain located?  At the North Pole ... Immediately over the central peak of Kwen-lun appears the Polar star, which is Shang-te's heavenly abode.  In the central place, the Polar star of Heaven, the one Bright One, the Great Monad always dwells.  In accordance with this conception, the Emperor and his assistants when officiating before the Altar of Heaven, always face the North.  The Pole-star itself is a prominent object of worship.""  -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (144, 216) Both the ancient Orientals and Greeks turned to face north before commencing prayer.  Homer states that when addressing the gods of ""Mount Olympus"" they would stretch their arms towards the Northern sky, and Plato also confirms that this ""holy habitation of Zeus was placed in the center of the world.""  Heraclitus said that ""it touches the ether and casts a shadow five thousand stadia in length.""  Herodotus stated the mountain to be ""very tapering and round; so lofty, moreover, that the top cannot be seen, the clouds never quitting it either summer or winter.  The natives call this mountain The Pillar of Heaven, and they themselves take their name from it, being called Atlantes.  They are reported not to eat any living thing.""  Strabo claimed it was an earthly paradise with gigantic olive trees and grape clusters a cubit in length.  Pliny described a river of milk descending from great heights and called the mountain a ""fabulosissimum.""  Maximus Tyrius claimed the ocean waves stopped short before reaching the mountain, ""standing up like a wall around its base, though unrestrained by any earthly barrier.  Nothing but the air and the sacred thicket prevent the water from reaching the mountain."" In the Phaedo, Socrates is quoted as saying, ""all things that grow trees and flowers and fruit are fairer than any here; and there are hills and stones in them smoother and more transparent and fairer in color than our highly-valued emeralds and sardonyx and jaspers and other gems, which are but minute fragments of them: for there all the stones are like our precious stones, and fairer still. The temperament of their seasons is such that the inhabitants have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and hearing and smell and all the other senses in much greater perfection. And they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell, and they hear their voices, and receive their answers, and are conscious of them, and hold converse with them, and they see the Sun, the Moon, and the stars as they really are."" ""The evidence that in ancient Hellenic thought, also, the heaven of the gods was in the northern sky is incidental, but cumulative and satisfactory. For example, heaven is upheld by Atlas, but the terrestrial station of Atlas, as we have elsewhere shown, is at the North Pole. Again, Olympos was the abode of the gods; but if the now generally current etymology of this term is correct, Olympos was simply the Atlantean pillar, pictured as a lofty mountain, and supporting the sky at its northern Pole. In fact, many writers now affirm that the Olympos of Greek mythology was originally simply the north polar ‘World-mountain' of the Asiatic nations."" -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (212) The ancient Germanic and Finnish people also, when praying or sacrificing to the gods, always faced north, and in the Scandinavian Eddas, both Asgard and Idavollr are represented as the ""navel"" or center of the world.  For them, atop the Yggdrasil tree at Earth's center was the heavenly ""Asgard,"" home of the gods.  Today we still pay respect to this primitive tradition at Christmas when we top our symbolic world trees with a bright yellow Pole star. ""We have already seen that the term 'navel' was anciently used in many languages for 'centre,' and that the Pole, or central point of the revolving constellations, was the 'Navel of Heaven.'  But as to the celestial Pole there corresponds a terrestrial one, so it is only natural that to the term the 'Navel of Heaven' there should be the corresponding expression the 'Navel of the Earth.'  Beginning with Christian traditions, let us make a pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. There, in the portion belonging to the Greek Christians, we shall discover a round pillar, some two feet high, projecting from the marble pavement, but supporting nothing. If we inquire as to its purpose, we shall be informed that it is designed to mark the exact centre or 'Navel' of the Earth. Early pilgrims and chroniclers refer to this curious monument, but its antiquity no one knows."" -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (227) In the Indian Puranas, both the terms ""Navel of the Earth,"" and ""Navel of Heaven,"" are used repeatedly and always referring to a place not in or near India, but rather at the North Pole.  Hymns from the Rig Veda speak of the ""supporting column of heaven"" otherwise known as the Atlas pillar of Vedic cosmology, and describe it as ""standing upon the Navel of Earth.""  In the fifth verse of the one hundred and eighty-fifth hymn, Day and Night are represented as twin sisters in the bosom of their parents Heaven and Earth, where they lock arms and spin circles around a common center point, namely the navel.  This is also echoed in a mysterious passage by Quintus Curtius which has baffled modern commentators stating how the object which represented the divine being resembled a ""navel set in gems."" “If anything is needed to disprove the common notion that geographical ignorance and national self-esteem first governed the ancient peoples in locating in their own countries ‘navels’ of the earth, it is furnished by what is, in all probability, the oldest epic in the world, that of Izdhubar, fragments of which have survived in the oldest literature of Babylonia. These fragments show that the earliest inhabitants of the Tigro-Euphrates basin located ‘the Centre of the Earth,’ not in their own midst, but in a far-off land, of sacred associations, where ‘the holy house of the gods’ is situated - a land ‘into the heart whereof man hath not penetrated;’ a place underneath the ‘overshadowing world-tree’ and beside the ‘full waters.’ No description could more perfectly identify the spot with the Arctic Pole of ancient Asiatic mythology. Yet this testimony stands not alone; for in the fragment of another ancient text, translated by Sayce in ‘Records of the Past,’ we are told of a ‘dwelling’ which ‘the gods created for’ the first human beings, - a dwelling in which they ‘became great’ and ‘increased in numbers,’ and the location of which is described in words exactly corresponding to those of Iranian, Indian, Chinese, Eddaic, and Aztec literature; namely, in the Centre of the Earth.”  -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (239-40) ""Among the ancient Inca-subjects of Peru was found the same idea of a Navel of the Earth, and even among the Chickasaws of Mississippi. Thus is all ancient thought full of this legendary idea of a mysterious, primeval, holy, Paradisiac Earth-centre, a spot connected as is no other with the 'Centre of Heaven,' the Paradise of God. Why it should be so no one has ever told us; but the hypothesis which places the Biblical Eden at the Pole, and makes all later earth navels commemorative of that primal one, affords a perfect explanation. In the light of it, there is no difficulty in understanding that Earth-centre in Jerusalem with which we began. The inconspicuous pillar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre symbolizes and commemorates far more than the geographical ignorance of mediaeval ages. It stands for the Japanese pillar by which the first soul born upon earth mounted to the sky. It stands for the World-column of the East-Aryans and the Chinvat Bridge of Iran. It stands for the law-proclaiming pillar of orichalcum in Atlantis, placed in the centre of the most central land. It stands for that Talmudic pillar by means of which the tenants of the terrestrial Paradise mount to the celestial, and, having spent the Sab- bath, return to pass the week below. It symbolizes Cardo, Atlas, Meru, Hara-berezaiti, Kharsak-Kurra, every fabulous mountain on whose top the sky pivots itself, and around which all the heavenly bodies ceaselessly revolve. It perpetuates a religious symbolism which existed in its region before ever Jerusalem had been made the Hebrew capital, recalling to our modern world the tabbur ha-aretz of a period anterior to the days of Samuel. In tradition it is said to mark the precise spot 'whence the clay was taken, out of which the body of Adam was modeled.' It does so, but it does it in a language and method which were common to all the most ancient nations of the earth. It points not to the soil in which it stands, but to the holier soil of a far-away primitive Eden."" -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (247-9) In Freemasonic temples, on Freemasonic tracing boards, and upon Freemasonic aprons can be found similar symbolism pointing to these concepts.  Namely, a flat Earth framed by pillars covered by an arch firmament, often with the tallest or most prominent pillar positioned centrally and a single eye representing Polaris situated above it.  The Sun and Moon are also usually shown on either side representing their paths/positions over and around the flat Earth.  This knowledge was clearly wide-spread among the ancient world but in modern times has become occulted by certain such secret societies and vested interests. ""Everywhere, therefore, in the most ancient ethnic thought, in the Egyptian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Indian, Persian, Chinese, and Greek, everywhere is encountered this conception of what, looked at with respect to its base and magnitude, is called the 'Mountain of the World,' but looked at with respect to its glorious summit and its celestial inhabitants is styled the 'Mountain of the Gods.' We need not pursue the investigation further. Enough has been said to warrant the assertion of Dr. Samuel Beal: 'It is plain that this idea of a lofty central primeval mountain belonged to the undivided human race.'  Elsewhere the same learned Sinologue has said, 'I have no doubt that the idea of a central mountain, and of the rivers flowing from it, and the abode of the gods upon its summit, is a primitive myth derived from the earliest traditions of our race.'"" -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (137) ""In concluding this sketch of ancient cosmology one further question naturally and inevitably thrusts itself upon us. It is this: How are the rise and the so wide diffusion of this singular world-view to be explained? In other words, how came it to pass that the ancestors of the oldest historic races and peoples agreed to regard the North Pole as the true summit of the earth and the circumpolar sky as the true heaven?""  -Dr. William Warren, “Paradise Found: The Cradle of the Human Race at the North Pole” (139)"
1,Flatlantis,"Flatlantis is an exploration into the history of Flat Earth, the mythology of Atlantis, and the mystery of Mount Meru, the alleged magnetic mountain ancient cultures worldwide believed existed at the North Pole. Beginning with a complete history of the geocentric flat Earth cosmology and subsequent gradual adoption of the heliocentric globe Earth model, Flatlantis then delves into ancient polar mythologies, early polar history/cartography, modern polar expeditions, and the myriad problems with claims made by Cook, Peary, Byrd, Scott, Amundsen, and other explorers. Finally, in a metaphysical twist, the book ends with research into Freemasonry, Christian esotericism, the Atlantean legend, Kundalini Yoga, ancient advanced civilizations and how they are all intimately connected to the North Pole. As with all of my books, Flatlantis will eventually in the coming months be released free as a series of articles and videos available for everyone. If you're able to support me however, please help out by purchasing a copy or two for yourself and family/friends. Thank you!"
2,How Everything Works on Flat Earth,"Flat Earth has long been touted as the mother of all conspiracy theories, marginalized, suppressed and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant ancient unscientific worldview, but the facts of the matter are far from what you have been told. ""How Everything Works on Flat Earth,"" elucidates exactly how the geocentric stationary plane model works and why the heliocentric spinning ball-Earth model is actually nothing but a pseudo-scientific deception."
3,Spirit Level: Full Album,"Our new flat-Earth themed chill-hop album ""Spirit Level,"" is now out and available on iTunes, Spotify, GooglePlay, Deezer, Amazon, and all major streaming services, free to watch/listen on LBRY, BitChute, Brighteon, Soundclick, Soundcloud and many other places but unfortunately not available on YouTube since they have already banned and given me supposed ""hate-speech"" strikes on several songs.  I have also been banned from BandCamp, CD Baby, and just this week had the entire Flat Earth Movement Album banned from all major streaming services.  Please support indie music while you still can and thank you so much!"
4,Eric Dubay Flat Earth Interviews,"The Oddest Vegan Couple sits down for a friendly dinner with flat Earth researcher and author Eric Dubay. In the following interview I sit down with Pablo Gabriel of the Spanish Perico Canta channel to discuss the state of the world, nutrition, well-being, activism, and of course Geocentrism. Big thanks to Del, Gav, Elissa Hawke, and Eddie Bravo for this excellent, informative and humorous discussion about the current state and future of the Flat Earth community. Freedom activist, comedian, and former People's Voice hostess Elissa Hawke sits down with IFERS President Eric Dubay to discuss dinosaurs, flat Earth, conspiracies, controlled opposition, and to address and clear-up several slanderous lies, accusations and rumors regarding Eric's background, family, and personal life. Big thanks to Eddie Bravo, Kron Gracie, and the rest of the guys for this ground-breaking podcast where we expose the dinosaur hoax, the nuclear hoax, evolution, the big bang, controlled opposition, NASA, and the flat Earth conspiracy. The podcast starts at 1:25 and contains a few technical audio issues, but overall came out very well and is essential viewing for flat-Earthers and ballers alike! Please help like, comment, share, subscribe, download and re-upload to help spread the word. In the following hangout with Del and the other guys from Beyond the Imaginary Curve, we discuss a variety of subjects including natural science, the law of perspective, spirituality, philosophy, veganism, martial arts, and of course the flat Earth. Eric Dubay, Head of the International Flat Earth Research Society is interviewed by Sean Condon of Truth Seekers Farm about several subjects including the Holohoax, International Jewry, Adolf Hitler, Pizzagate, Psychopathy, and Flat Earth. Thanks to Mel Fabregas of Veritas Radio for publicly releasing this second part of our important interview (normally reserved for subscribers only) where we delve into topics from the fake spinning ball Earth, to fake aliens, fake dinosaurs, fake ape-men, and evidence of real giant human beings covered up by the Masonic establishment. Eric Dubay says the greatest lie and most successful cover-up in history, NASA and Freemasonry's biggest secret, is that we live on a plane, not a planet; that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe. Eric is an American living in Thailand where he teaches Yoga and Wing Chun part-time while exposing the New World Order full-time. He is the author of five books and is the president of the International Flat Earth Research Society. From Mel Fabregas: Let me begin this interview by stating that I have no attachment to the flat earth. I have no attachment to the oblate spheroid, and even to the sphere. If our home is any of these, so be it. I wouldn't be surprised of any. What I continue to be surprised and suspicious of are the people who continue attacking those who simply ask questions. I recently attended a conference that deals with the most open minded topics you could possibly imagine. However, when it comes to the flat earth topic, it was a no no. Look, I can't say I blame people for thinking this is the most absurd topic under the sun, or the firmament, rather, but you, open minded people who discuss aliens, UFOs, reptilians who rule the world, Bigfoot, and the rest of it, why do you continue telling people to stop looking into the flat earth? Those of you who study the pyramids and ancient civilizations, you venerate these ancient ones, and rightfully so, and some of these very ancient ones believed the earth was flat. Why do you then continue looking into their achievements if the notion of a flat earth is so absurd? Shouldn't that discredit them too? And those of you who continue writing to me saying the ancient ones knew they lived on a sphere, how did they know? Perhaps they had advanced technology that allowed seeing the skies above. Just because you see sphere above you doesn't prove you are standing on one. You can still play pool on a flat table and basketball on a flat court. Perhaps the psyop is questioning those who question the true shape of our plane(t). Thanks to Evita Ochel of EBTV for the wonderful interview covering topics ranging from spirituality and science, to health and veganism, to conspiracies and the flat Earth. Please like, share, comment and subscribe to help me spread the word on these most important subjects! Tonight Eric Dubay returns to the show. Eric is a leading and prominent voice behind the revival of the Flat Earth theory. He currently lives in Thailand where he teaches Yoga and Wing Chun which is the traditional Chinese martial art of self defense. Eric has also written a number of books one of which is The Flat Earth Conspiracy where Eric explains how the world has been systematically brainwashed and indoctrinated for centuries into believing the greatest lie of all time – that the Earth is a spinning globe. He has also recently released his free eBook “200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball”. The discussion with Eric was wide ranging as we talk about the traction the Flat Earth theory is gaining throughout the world along with Eric’s thoughts on Zionism, controlled opposition, psychopathic behavior and forbidden topics like the Holocaust. Continuing my discussion with Mel Fabregas of Veritas Radio, we discuss subjects ranging from the Sun, Moon, and stars, UFOs, aliens, and DMT, Jews, Hitler and WWII, and of course, the flat Earth. If you missed part one be sure to watch this first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yRAQG5-ca8 And special thanks to Steve Wilner for the awesome psychedelic visuals: https://www.youtube.com/user/soundlessdawn Join me and Mel Fabregas of Veritas Radio for a discussion about the greatest deception in history, the mother of all conspiracies, NASA and Freemasonry's biggest secret, that Earth is flat, motionless, and the center of the universe. Stay tuned for part 2 coming out next week, or better yet show Mel your support and subscribe to Veritas radio to listen today. In this Firestarter radio re-upload we cover the Flat Earth, NASA, Freemasonry, Judaism, Veganism, Kosher Slaughter, Circumcision, Hitler, the Holocaust Hoax, Controlled Opposition, who really runs the world and why they have convinced you you are living on a spinning ball! In the following re-upload, Patricia Aiken from Sacred Cow BBQ and I discuss the Flat Earth, WWII, Hitler, Gaddafi, Rothschild / Jewish power, Controlled Opposition, and Voluntaryism. In this roundtable discussion with John Le Bon and the Ball Earth Skeptics we cover topics ranging from shills in the flat Earth movement to astrotheology and kundalini awakening. Tonight my very special guest is Eric Dubay. Eric is one of the leading voices behind the revival of the Flat Earth theory. He currently lives in Thailand where he teaches Yoga and Wing Chun which is the traditional Chinese martial art of self defense. Eric has also written a number of books one of which is The Flat Earth Conspiracy where Eric explains how the world has been systematically brainwashed and indoctrinated for centuries into believing the greatest lie of all time – that the Earth is a spinning globe. Our discussion was wide ranging as we talk through many of the proof points supporting the Flat Earth model as well addressing some the arguments used by heliocentrists, or the globe believers, in their attempts to debunk the flat Earth theory. I strongly urge everyone to listen with an open and critical mind. I believe you’ll find the topic extremely interesting and not as cut and dry as you might think. Coast 2 Coast AM regular stand-in and host of Zoomer radio's Conspiracy Show, Richard Syrett, interviews Eric Dubay, president of the International Flat Earth Research Society about the greatest lie and most successful cover-up in history, NASA and Freemasonry's biggest secret, that we live on a plane, not a planet, that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe. In this episode of The Anarchast I speak with Jeff Berwick about Statism, Anarchy/Voluntaryism and of course, the Flat Earth!

Also check out my Anarchy article archive at Atlantean Conspiracy: http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/search/label/Anarchy The oldest and largest secret society in existence has a secret so huge and well-hidden, so contrary to what we have been taught to believe, that its exposure threatens to not only completely and single-handedly crush their New World Order ""United Nations"" but to radically reshape the entirety of modern academia, universities, the mainstream / alternative medias, all the world's governments, space agencies, and the very Earth beneath our feet. In this highly-informative and humorous podcast President of the International Flat Earth Research Society and webmaster of AtlanteanConspiracy.com, Eric Dubay, talks with fellow conspiracy author and webmaster of WaykiWayki.com, Mark Knight. Topics covered include flat Earth science vs. ball Earth pseudo-science, the various proofs/evidence for the geocentric flat Earth and debunking the supposed proofs/evidence for the heliocentric ball-Earth, the North Pole and South Pole (or lack thereof) and the Antarctic ice-rim, the Sun, Moon, eclipses, seasons, Polaris, stars, planets, NASA, the fake Moon and Mars landings, the controlled opposition Flat Earth Society vs. the legitimate International Flat Earth Research Society, and disinformation agents like Mark Sargent (codename: Sargent Non-Sense). The following interview features myself, Eric Dubay, a genuine, legitimate flat Earth researcher talking with DJ Buttamilk (Dan Lefkowitz) of Brattleboro, Vermont community radio."
5,The Flat Earth Conspiracy Audiobook,"Wolves in sheep’s clothing have pulled the wool over our eyes. For almost 500 years, the masses have been thoroughly deceived by a cosmic fairy-tale of astronomical proportions. We have been taught a falsehood so gigantic and diabolical that it has blinded us from our own experience and common sense, from seeing the world and the universe as they truly are. Through pseudo-science books and programs, mass media and public education, universities and government propaganda, the world has been systematically brain-washed, slowly indoctrinated over centuries into the unquestioning belief of the greatest lie of all time.

6,The Self-Luminescent Semi-Transparent Moon,"NASA and modern astronomy maintain that the Moon is a solid, 
spherical, Earth-like habitation which man has actually flown to and set
 foot on. They claim the Moon is a non-luminescent planetoid which 
receives and reflects all its light from the Sun.  The reality is, 
however, that the Moon is not a solid body, it is clearly circular, but 
not spherical, and not in any way an Earth-like planetoid which humans 
could set foot on. In fact, the Moon is largely transparent and 
completely self-luminescent, shining with its own unique light. The Sun’s light is golden, warm, drying, preservative and 
antiseptic, while the Moon’s light is silver, cool, damp, putrefying and
 septic. The Sun’s rays decrease the combustion of a bonfire, while the 
Moon’s rays increase combustion. Plant and animal substances exposed to 
sunlight quickly dry, shrink, coagulate, and lose the tendency to 
decompose and putrify; grapes and other fruits become solid, partially 
candied and preserved like raisins, dates, and prunes; animal flesh 
coagulates, loses its volatile gaseous constituents, becomes firm, dry, 
and slow to decay. When exposed to moonlight, however, plant and animal 
substances tend to show symptoms of putrefaction and decay. In direct sunlight a thermometer will read higher than another 
thermometer placed in the shade, but in full, direct moonlight a 
thermometer will read lower than another placed in the shade. If the 
Sun’s light is collected in a large lens and thrown to a focus point it 
can create significant heat, while the Moon’s light collected similarly 
creates no heat. In the “Lancet Medical Journal,” from March 14th, 1856,
 particulars are given of several experiments which proved the Moon’s 
rays when concentrated can actually reduce the temperature upon a 
thermometer more than eight degrees. The sun’s light, when concentrated by a number of plane or 
concave mirrors throwing the light to the same point; or by a large 
burning lens, produces a black or non-luminous focus, in which the heat 
is so intense that metallic and alkaline substances are quickly fused; 
earthy and mineral compounds almost immediately vitrified; and all 
animal and vegetable structures in a few seconds decomposed, burned up 
and destroyed. The moon’s light concentrated in the above manner 
produces a focus so brilliant and luminous that it is difficult to look 
upon it; yet there is no increase of temperature. In the focus of 
sun-light there is great heat but no light. In that of the moon’s light 
there is great light but no heat Light which is reflected must necessarily be of the same 
character as that which causes the reflection, but the light of the Moon
 is altogether different from the light of the Sun, therefore the light 
of the Moon is not reflected from the Sun. The Sun’s light is red and 
hot, the Moon’s pale and cold -the Sun’s dries and preserves certain 
kinds of fish and fruit, such as cod and grapes, for the table, but the 
Moon’s turns such to putrefaction -the Sun’s will often put out a coal 
fire, while the Moon’s will cause it to bum more brightly -the rays of 
the Sun, focused through a burning-glass, will set wood on fire, and 
even fuse metals, while the rays of the Moon, concentrated to the 
strongest power, do not exhibit the very slightest signs of heat. I have
 myself long thought that the light of the Moon is Electric, but, be 
that as it may, even a Board School child can perceive that its light is
 totally unlike that of the Sun. So sunlight and moonlight clearly have altogether different 
properties, and furthermore the Moon itself cannot physically be both a 
spherical body and a reflector of the Sun’s light!  Reflectors must be 
flat or concave for light rays to have any angle of incidence; If a 
reflector’s surface is convex then every ray of light points in a direct
 line with the radius perpendicular to the surface resulting in no 
reflection. Again, if the Moon is a sphere, which it is declared to be, 
how can its surface reflect the light of the Sun? If her surface was a 
mass of polished silver, it could not reflect from more than a mere 
point! Let a silvered glass ball or globe of considerable size be held 
before a lamp or fire of any magnitude, and it will be seen that instead
 of the whole surface reflecting light, there will be a very small 
portion only illuminated. But the Moon‟s whole surface is brilliantly 
illuminated! A condition or effect utterly impossible if it be spherical The Bible also confirms that the Moon is self-luminescent and not a
 mere reflector of sunlight in Genesis 1:16 where it states that “God 
made two great luminaries, the greater luminary to rule the day, and the
 lesser luminary to rule the night.” Not only is the Moon clearly self-luminescent, shining its own 
unique light, but it is also largely transparent! NASA photoshoppers 
claim the Moon is a dark spherical planetoid, yet with our own eyes or 
through a telescope we can see it is actually a bright, circular, 
semi-transparent luminary. On a clear night, during a waxing or waning 
cycle, it is even possible to occasionally see stars and planets 
directly through the surface of the Moon! On
 March 7th, 1794, four astronomers (3 in Norwich, 1 in London) wrote in 
“The Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Astronomical Society” that 
they “saw a star in the dark part of the moon, which had not then 
attained the first quadrature; and from the representations which are 
given the star must have appeared very far advanced upon the disc.” Sir 
James South of the Royal Observatory in Kensington wrote in a letter to 
the Times newspaper April 7, 1848, that, “On the 15th of March, 
1848,when the moon was seven and a half days old, I never saw her 
unillumined disc so beautifully. On my first looking into the telescope a
 star of about the 7th magnitude was some minutes of a degree distant 
from the moon’s dark limb. I saw that its occultation by the moon was 
inevitable … The star, instead of disappearing the moment the moon’s 
edge came in contact with it, apparently glided on the moon’s dark face,
 as if it had been seen through a transparent moon; or, as if a star 
were between me and the moon … I have seen a similar apparent projection
 several times … The cause of this phenomenon is involved in 
impenetrable mystery.” In the monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical 
Society for June 8, 1860, Thomas Gaunt stated that the “Occultation of 
Jupiter by the moon, on the 24th of May, 1860, was seen with an 
achromatic of 3.3 inches aperture, 50 inches focus; the immersion with a
 power of 50, and the emersion with a power of 70. At the immersion I 
could not see the dark limb of the moon until the planet appeared to 
touch it, and then only to the extent of the diameter of the planet; but
 what I was most struck with was the appearance on the moon as it passed
 over the planet. It appeared as though the planet was a dark object, 
and glided on to the moon instead of behind it; and the appearance 
continued until the planet was hid, when I suddenly lost the dark limb 
of the moon altogether.” I have personally also seen stars through the edge of the 
waxing/waning Moon. It actually happens fairly often; if you are 
diligent and specifically observing for the phenomenon on starry nights 
you can occasionally see it even with the naked eye. During a partial solar eclipse the sun’s outline has many 
times been seen through the body of the moon. But those who have been 
taught to believe that the moon is a solid opaque sphere, are ever ready
 with ‘explanations,’ often of the most inconsistent character, rather 
than acknowledge the simple fact of semi-transparency. Not only has this
 been proved by the visibility of the sun’s outline through segments, 
and sometimes the very centre of the moon, but often, at new moon, the 
outline of the whole, and even the several shades of light on the 
opposite and illuminated part have been distinctly seen. In other words 
we are often able to see through the dark side of the moon’s body to 
light on the other side. That the moon is not a perfectly opaque body, but a 
crystallized substance, is shown from the fact that when a few hours old
 or even at quarter we can through the unilluminated portion see the 
light shining on the other side. Stars have also been observed through 
her surface! A Star occulting a crescent Moon has long been a popular symbol of 
Islam, was the symbol of the Ottoman Empire, it is found on the flags of
 Algeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Pakistan, Singapore, 
Tunisia, Turkey, and in the Coat of Arms of countries from Croatia, to 
Germany, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Ukraine and the 
United Kingdom. Its origins can be traced back thousands of years to 
ancient Hindu culture where it is found in the symbol for the word “Om,”
 the primary name for the almighty, representing the union of god Shiva 
and goddess Shakti. Why the symbol has carried such widespread 
historical significance is open to interpretation, but regardless of 
interpretation, the image of star(s) occulting the Moon has long been a 
prevalent and meaningful picture. That stars and planets have been seen through
 the Moon is a fact, but to this day NASA, modern astronomy and a world 
full of brainwashed heliocentrists maintain that the Moon is a 
spherical, Earth-like habitation capable of landing spaceships on. They 
claim the Moon (and Mars for that matter!) are habitable desert planets,
 much like Star Wars’ Tatooine, Dune’s Arrakis and other such imaginary 
science-fiction worlds. Since long before the staged Apollo“Moon 
landings” these Masonic Sun-worshipping heliocentrists have been 
claiming the Moon to be a solid planetoid complete with plains, 
plateaus, mountains, valleys and craters though nothing of the sort can 
be discerned even using the best telescopes. Astronomers have indulged in imagination
 to such a degree that the moon is now considered to be a solid, opaque 
spherical world, having mountains, valleys, lakes, or seas, volcanic 
craters, and other conditions analogous to the surface of the earth. So 
far has this fancy been carried that the whole visible disc has been 
mapped out, and special names given to its various peculiarities, as 
though they had been carefully observed, and actually measured by a 
party of terrestrial ordinance surveyors. All this has been done in 
direct opposition to the fact that whoever, for the first time, and 
without previous bias of mind, looks at the moon’s surface through a 
powerful telescope, is puzzled to say what it is really like, or how to 
compare it with anything known to him. The comparison which may be made 
will depend upon the state of mind of the observer. It is well known 
that persons looking at the rough bark of a tree, or at the irregular 
lines or veins in certain kinds of marble and stone, or gazing at the 
red embers in a dull fire will, according to the degree of activity of 
the imagination, be able to see many different forms, even the outlines 
of animals and of human faces. It is in this way that persons may fancy 
that the moon’s surface is broken up into hills and valleys, and other 
conditions such as are found on earth. But that anything really similar 
to the surface of our own world is anywhere visible upon the moon is 
altogether fallacious."
7,"Flat Earth Activism: Schools, Prisons, Libraries and Bookstores","Since I was 5 years old I began writing short stories and told  my parents that I wanted to be an author when I grew up.  Fast-forward and my 37th birthday next week will mark 11 years since the publishing of my first books Asbestos Head and The Atlantean Conspiracy.  At the time I sent the manuscripts to over 200 literary agents and publishers hoping to get wide distribution through an established company.  Due to the sensitive subject matter, however, not a single agent or publisher was willing to take them on.  My only available option left was self-publishing and independent distribution.  In order to get them known and read, I offered online versions completely free and have since self-published 4 more books.  My most recent, the first ever illustrated flat Earth children's book, ""The Earth Plane,"" has been translated to 10 languages, and my most-popular ""200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball"" translated into a whopping 25 languages all for free by dedicated, generous bilingual activists looking to get them into as many hands as possible. The difficulty with self-publishing and independent distribution, however, is that established channels with in-routes to bookstores, schools and libraries have almost no way of knowing about your books.  As a result, even though my PDFs have now been downloaded and read by millions of people, physical copies have not received such a warm welcome, and have yet to make it into bookstores, schools and libraries where they could do the most benefit.  I recently thought, as a personal favor to me, for my birthday this year, from anyone who is willing and able, there is nothing I would wish more than for your help getting my books into bookstores, schools and libraries around the world.  Alone it would be a pipe-dream, but with just a few minutes of your time, my wish could very easily come true. What I'm asking of everyone is simply this:  The next time you visit your local big chain or independent bookstore, your community library, or nearby school, university or prison library, recommend and request that they carry Eric Dubay's books.  They can all be found on both Amazon and Lulu, and most bookstores and libraries will be able to carry them on special request.  Some stores will order them just on recommendation, while others will require you to purchase a copy through them; likewise some libraries will order just based on suggestion, and others will only carry them if you donate copies.  I have personally bought copies  of my books to give to community libraries in Maine, USA where I'm from, and heard many inspiring life-changing stories of inmates who read copies of my books donated to prison libraries.  If you could buy and donate, or at least make a special request to your local bookstores and libraries to carry my books, I would really appreciate it. Big publishing companies with wide distribution networks simply won't touch the controversial, paradigm-shifting material covered in my books, and so the only way to actually get them into the hands of the minds that most need them the most, is to independently approach them and get them there ourselves.  Thank you so much to anyone who can help make this happen and to everyone who has shown their support."
8,Ahead of the Curve,"By now, the majority of flat Earthers and millions of globe Earthers alike have seen the Netflix hit-piece mockumentary ""Behind the Curve,"" starring many of the worst controlled opposition disinformation agents known in the community, intentionally making the subject of ""flat Earth"" seem as ridiculous as possible.

10,Concave Earth Debunked,"Anyone looking into alternative Earth cosmologies will inevitably run across 3 main options for the general alleged shape of the Earth.  Either Earth is a level plane devoid of any curvature, a convex sphere upon which we live outside, or lastly, a concave sphere upon which we live inside.  The majority of my work contains undeniable proof as to what the objective reality of this situation is, and debunks the majority belief that Earth is a convex spinning ball, but in this article/video I will specifically address and debunk the claim that Earth is concave. In my books and videos you will find hundreds upon hundreds of proofs that Earth is devoid of any convex curvature, and the vast majority of these proofs double to show that Earth is also devoid of any concave curvature.  For example, the natural physics of large bodies of water is to seek its lowest level with the surface of all standing water remaining perfectly flat from end to end of its container.  Whether in a beaker, bottle or bathtub, pond, lake or ocean, this tangible substance which we can all confirm for ourselves, is incapable of supporting itself into any shape whatsoever.  Regardless of what shape the ground beneath takes, the surface of standing water remains perfectly horizontal.  This alone destroys the unscientific, unobservable, unrepeatable claim that Earth is a concave or convex ball. The perfectly flat horizon seen for hundreds upon hundreds of miles at the highest altitude any amateur balloon, camera or human has ever reached, also shows beyond any shadow of doubt that Earth is not concave or convex.  For Earth to be a ball of the dimensions claimed, means that it must curve (upwards or downwards!) at a rate of h = r - r cos(s/2r) where h = height, r = radius, and s = arc length.  When calculated for up to nearly 1000 miles (which is plenty far for any practical observations we can make) this trigonometrical formula can also be simplified to 7.98 inches per mile squared and receive the same results.  This means an easily visible and measurable curvature of 6 feet after 3 miles, 24 feet after 6 miles, 54 feet after 9 miles and so on would and must exist if we truly lived on a concave or convex Earth 24,900 miles in circumference.  Countless experiments using lasers, spirit levels, theodolites, sextants, telescopes, super-zoom cameras, and Navy rail guns have all confirmed however that no such alleged curvature exists. Again, there are hundreds more such proofs available in my other works showing the objective reality of our cosmology, so now I will specifically address the evidence given by concave Earthers to substantiate their belief that we are living inside a ball.  The largest collection of concave Earth evidences I have been able to find, belongs to the Wild Heretic blog where he has amassed the following 10: For his first point of evidence, Wild Heretic refers to the Glen McLaughlin Map Collection dating from the 17th through 19th centuries whose latitude and longitude lines have been curved “the other way” than we are used to, giving them the appearance of concavity rather than convexity.  He then concludes that these map-makers could have had special knowledge of Earth's concavity and attributes a random, subjective number of 10% to the veracity of this evidence to prove that Earth is concave.  Now, anyone can draw a map of any shape they would like, and that has exactly 0% relevance and gives 0% evidence of the actual shape of the objective world we all inhabit.  There are many maps in existence that show Earth to be diamond-shaped, heart-shaped, rectangular, and even the shape of a large letter M!  The existence of such maps does not provide 10% or even 1% evidence that Earth is a diamond, heart, rectangle or letter M, just as these concave Earth projections fail to provide any evidence for their claim. For his second point of evidence, Wild Heretic refers to modern Polyconic Map projections, which are ironically flat Earth maps, but drawn with concave latitude and longitude lines.  Since this projection was ""in common use by many map-making agencies of the United States from the time of its proposal by Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler in 1825 until the middle of the 20th century,"" and used by the US Military and Geodetic Survey, Wild Heretic attributes an arbitrary 60% to this piece of evidence in proving Concave Earth.  Once again, anyone can draw maps of any shape, and these flat maps with concave lines over them, have exactly 0% relevance and give exactly 0% evidence of the actual shape of the objective world we all inhabit. For his third point of evidence, Wild Heretic again refers to flat Earth material but claiming it as concave Earth evidence.  This time, quoting Samuel Rowbotham's Earth Not a Globe, he shows a picture and quotes from the book discussing how early hot air balloonists, expecting to see convex curvature beneath them due to their globe beliefs, were shocked that the appearance was instead concave because the horizon rose to eye level along with them while the Earth below them continued to sink away.  Wild Heretic conveniently glosses over the proceeding pages where Samuel Rowbotham clearly shows this concave appearance to be the result of plane perspective.  The fact that the horizon literally rises up along with the observer/camera as high as they go, shows that we are dealing with a subjective element of vision, not objective tangible reality.  If that was the case, then pilots viewing the horizon straight in front of them flying level on long-haul flights should, would, and must eventually come face to face with and inevitably crash into the supposed concave Earth horizon directly in front of them.  This never has, never could and never will happen of course, because the eye-level horizon is simply an element of point perspective and the way our eyes perceive the world.  If the horizon was an objective tangible facet of reality, it would remain where it was regardless of altitude, and not constantly change based on the position of each observer.  These 19th century balloonists quoted also only reached an altitude of 1-2 miles high.  Today we have hundreds of amateur balloon videos exceeding 20+ miles high which still show a perfectly flat horizon 360 degrees around with the horizon rising to eye-level the entire way.  Regardless of this, Wild Heretic claims this point of evidence lifted from Rowbotham's seminal Flat Earth book somehow gives 30% evidence for concave Earth.  Which orifice he is pulling theses percentages from is anyone's guess. For his fourth point of evidence, Wild Heretic refers to J.B Watson's 1901 Tamarack mine experiment where he suspended 4250 foot long plumb lines down copper mine shafts and found the plumb lines were slightly farther apart at the bottom than at the top, concluding from the results that Earth is concave.  The experiment began by suspending two #24 steel piano wires with 50 pound cast iron bobs hanging 4250 feet down Tamarack mine shaft 5.  The plumbs were 15 feet apart from one another and measured a divergence of 0.07-0.11 feet at the bottom after several tests.  In an attempt to rule out magnetism between the iron ventilation pipes running down the western side of the shaft and the plumb bobs, 50 pound lead balls were used and the test repeated with the length of the wires 120 feet shorter and situated in shaft 2; again, recording a divergence of 0.1 feet.  In a third attempt, trying to rule out magnetism, the same experiments were repeated in 1902 in shaft 4, but with #20 bronze piano wires carrying 60-pound lead bobs approximately 15 feet apart and 4,440 feet in length. This time instead of diverging, Watson recorded a convergence of 0.028 feet.  Changing again to steel wire and trying both iron and lead bobs gave similar convergent results in shaft 4.  Lastly, the test was repeated once more in shaft 5 with the bronze wire and lead bobs this time resulting in the biggest divergent reading of 0.141 feet. The inconsistency between results of various shafts using various materials led Watson and associates to theorize that circulating air must be affecting the experiment.  They managed to block off most of the updraft by moving the wire, sealing the top and leaving only a small circulating air current due to the hot air at the bottom of the shaft naturally moving up to the colder air on top.  This time they measured and found the lines to be nearly parallel diverging only a minuscule 0.018 feet in shaft 5, and 0.04 feet in shafts 2 and 4.  When calculations were done on these final tests, the tiny divergence recorded was allegedly very near to what would be expected on their concave Earth model. Now, firstly, plumb lines have been used above ground in construction flawlessly for millennia providing builders perfectly straight vertical lines with zero convergence or divergence from which to build gigantic balanced sturdy structures from the Roman Colosseum to the Burj Khalifa.  To throw out thousands of years of practical perfectly vertical plumb line measurements used by millions of builders the world over throughout history, in favor of the wildly inconsistent underground results of one 20th century concave Earth theorist is simply untenable and frankly absurd.  Secondly, steel and iron are overtly magnetic, while bronze and lead not considered ""magnetic"" still interact with and are affected and moved by magnetic fields.  Thus measuring convergence or divergence of metal plumb lines with metal plumb bobs down mine shafts full of various potentially magnetic materials, including the admitted iron ventilation pipes is truly disingenuous and ignoring the most probable problem.  And thirdly, the circulating air currents which Watson and associates were never fully able to negate, are yet another obvious reason for the inconsistent results.  Cherry-picking the final test results that best fit their theory while ignoring the previous results and thousands of years of perfectly vertical plumb lines again is incredibly disingenuous and untenable, but Wild Heretic gives this experiment a 50% rating for proving concave Earth. For his fifth point of evidence, Wild Heretic refers to an anecdotal experiment claimed to have been done by an anonymous YouTube commenter.  You read/heard correctly, Wild Heretic's fifth proof the Earth is concave, is a single unrecorded experiment claimed to have been performed by some YouTube commenter with no content who doesn't even use his real name.  In the comments section of a Polish YouTube video against the concave Earth theory, Wild Heretic read and relates the comments made by one ""Ar Pi,"" who was allegedly skeptical of the ""cellular Earth theory"" until he shined a laser across a 2 kilometer lake and concluded the Earth is concave.  ""Ar Pi"" states that, ""Me and my friend stuck a vertical stake in the water and fixed the laser on it on the height of 30 cm above water surface. My friend sailed to the other shore, about 2 km from the first stake and placed a stake there too. By communicating on the phone I set the laser beam on his stake at the same height, 30 cm above water surface. When he confirmed the height was the same on his stake too, the laser was then rigidly fixed to the first stake with two wing screws. My friend sailed back to my position and together we made a measurement in the middle of the distance between the two stakes. The measurement showed that the distance from water surface to the beam was 39-40 cm!"" Now to begin with, this single anecdotal experiment was not recorded and therefore is nothing but unevidenced hearsay which Wild Heretic laughably attributes a whopping 75% veracity on his ridiculous percentage proof scale.  Secondly, we know for a fact, as it is an undeniable, tangible, observable, repeatable aspect of reality that large bodies of undisturbed water always remain perfectly horizontal with no deviation in elevation from end to end.  In fact, it is water itself which has universally been used for millennia as a leveling tool by builders as it is the easiest and most reliable method of finding true level.  Therefore to claim a 2 kilometer wide lake somehow maintains a 10 centimeter dip in the middle, goes against millennia of well-established, easily verifiable, tangible scientific objective reality we can all test for ourselves.  Thirdly, Mr. ""Ar Pi"" never mentions if or how he leveled the laser, which if he didn't, exposes an obvious glaring problem in his experiment, and if he did, then he would literally and paradoxically have been using a water level to look over level water in order to claim water isn't level.  Lastly, there are hundreds of successful tests (which been recorded) using lasers, theodolites, spirit levels, sextants, telescopes, zoom cameras and other technologies to prove that bodies of water at rest do not curve whatsoever. For his sixth point of evidence, Wild Heretic references the ""Rectilineator"" experiment performed by Cyrus Teed and his Koreshan Unity members in the late 19th century.  Cyrus Teed was a man who claimed to be Christ, renamed himself ""Koresh,"" and created a commune for followers of his ""Koreshanity.""  He also wrote a book claiming the Earth to be concave and attempted to prove this with his infamous rectilineator experiment.  It turns out his ""rectilineator"" was really just a fancy name for a few sections of glorified fence posting. Mr. Cyrus Koresh Christ Teed made a series of 12-foot long, 8-inch wide mahogany supports held up by vertical posts with brass castings which could be adjusted for height by turning screws on the front sides of each.  His experiment was to take these sections of fence to a 4 mile stretch of Naples Bay and by lining them up end to end calculate any potential concave curvature that might be found between his fence posts and the sea level.  Logistically he was unable to create 4 miles of this kind of rectilineator post, so instead settled for just making a few short sections, unscrewing then re-using them as he went along the beach. Since the beach sand was anything but level, Teed and his Koreshans had to continuously excavate digging and dumping sand to create a level line along the beach side.  Once each section of fence was posted, it was checked by a plumb line, spirit level and geodetic level, then at every eighth of a mile, the height of the horizontal support was measured against the water level beneath.  Since the water was tidal, Teed used something called a ""caisson"" which artificially creates a perforated basin giving him sections of still water to measure against.  Teed argued that if the distance between the waterline and the rectilineator was the same at each 1/8 mile measurement, this would prove the Earth to be flat.  If the distance continually increased, Earth was convex; and if the distance decreased, Earth was concave.  Low and behold, Teed found the distances continually lessened and reached his hoped for conclusion. Now to begin with, note that this experiment was performed not by a secular, unbiased, man of science, but rather by an active religious cult leader whose following was highly predicated on his claims that Earth was concave.  Secondly, his experiment has never been repeated, so we only have Teed and his Koreshans word as to the accuracy of their leveling abilities and calculations.  Thirdly, there are several factors that could and would skew the data gathered for this experiment.  For example, Teed admitted that even though the level of the supports was tested every eighth of a mile, his equipment was not sensitive enough to give accurate readings for the first several sections; the method of confirming the cassion level with each 1/8 mile tide stick was by observation through a telescope, which introduced a huge element of potential human error; the wood and brass parts used were inevitably subject to slight expansion or contractions with changes in temperature and humidity; and the sand over which they tested was also most certainly subject to subsidence over time causing more inevitable slight decreases in height as they went (which serendipitously just happens to favor their hoped for concave results).  Regardless of all this, Wild Heretic and most other Concave Earthers quote this flawed, heavily biased, unrepeated experiment as their most solid proof of Earth's concavity.  Thus the ""Rectilineator"" receives a 99% veracity rating from Wild Heretic, and he also claims that if and when Lord Steven Christ (a contemporary Concave Earth cult leader who also believes himself to be Jesus) repeats Teed's experiment with positive results, this will be 100, yes, 100% proof that Earth is concave. For his seventh point of evidence, Wild Heretic references long-distance observation of islands, mountains and buildings which would be invisible behind hundreds or thousands of feet of convex curvature if Earth was truly a ball 25,000 miles in circumference.  Once again, taking flat Earth evidence and conflating it as concave, Wildly Speculative Heretic admits this evidence works equally well on a flat Earth, but then later concludes it to somehow be 75% concave proof on his random rating scale.  The truth is that objects can indeed be seen much farther than is allowed on a convex ball 25,000 miles in circumference, and this is in perfect alignment with the law of perspective on plane surfaces, but not in any way evidence that Earth is curving upwards as concave theorists claim.  The fact that the horizon shows the ground beneath your feet rising to your eye level is a matter of perspective and the way our eyes perceive the world, which we can test and confirm ourselves by rising in altitude and seeing the subjective horizon expanding and rising to our level, or by walking to an object on the horizon over flat land, and confirming the ground that was then at eye level is now under our feet without us ever actually changing elevation. For his eighth point of evidence, Wild Heretic basically re-iterates point seven regarding seeing distant objects (which was just shown to be proof of flatness, not concave curvature), but this time focusing specifically on zooming-in objects which have disappeared into the horizon.  Islands, lighthouses or ships which are partially obscured or completely eclipsed by the horizon can be brought back into full view with the aid of binoculars, telescopes or zoom cameras.  The fact that ships disappear hull first when sailing away from the shoreline is once again an element of perspective on plane surfaces.  A person walking away from you on a football field or other longer flat surface will also similarly start to disappear from the ground up starting with their shoes, then their ankles, legs and so on until they appear to be a floating legless torso at a far enough distance.  But we can easily prove this is just an element of perspective by zooming in and seeing their entire body, legs and all, or the entire ship, hull and all, come fully back into view.  As usual, this is a solid proof of perspective over planar surfaces, but Wild Heretic claims it as 85% proof that Earth is concave. For his ninth point of evidence, Wild Heretic says and I quote:  ""Light must bend upwards in a concave Earth in order to make sense… and there is some evidence of that.""  He then goes on to reference a single anecdotal experiment done by one Wilhelm Martin who hypothesizes bendy light as the reason for the results of a theodolite test he performed over 2000 meters.  His test was far from perfect, yielding constantly changing results, with several problem factors including wind, temperature/humidity considerations and refraction, but rather than focusing on faults of the experiment, for this ninth piece of supposed concave Earth evidence, I would like to point out that it is actually irrelevant regardless.  As Wild Heretic stated, ""light must bend upwards in a concave Earth in order to make sense,""however, it is a fallacy of affirming the consequent in formal logic to state that light must bend for concave theory to be true, then show an example of bending light, and conclude therefore that the Earth is concave.  This is the same fallacy Neil DeGrasse Tyson used when Joe Rogan asked him how we can be sure humans went to the Moon and he responded by saying we know they went there because the Saturn V rocket was loaded with enough fuel to get there.  Just because there was enough fuel to get there, or just because an example of bending light can be shown, does not mean man walked on the Moon or the Earth is concave.  This is a great example of the fallacious sophistry used by both concave and convex Earthers, sophistry that Wild Heretic ascribes a completely undeserved 95% veracity rating on his non-sense scale. And for his final point of evidence, Wild Heretic simply re-iterates the previous nine showing his percentages for each, encouraging the reader to agree that so many arbitrary percentage points couldn't possibly be wrong, and that the only fair conclusion is to concede concave Earth.  I'm sorry to disappoint Mr. Heretic, but common sense tells us we live on a level motionless plane with the Sun, Moon and stars revolving over and around us, just as you experience every day.  The idea that people, buildings and oceans are all somehow stuck to and curving around the inside of a ball is just as ridiculous and impossible as the idea that people, buildings and oceans are all somehow stuck to and curving around the outside of a ball.  Both the convex and concave models require the complete abandonment of our common sense and experience which tells us clearly and obviously that people in one part of the world are not living upside-down with respect to people in any other part of the world.  Planes do not curve their paths upwards or downwards during their flights in order to maintain altitude as they would have to on concave or convex Earths.  The mechanical gyroscopes operating each artificial horizon on every single plane is proof positive as they remain rigid in space that pilots reach their desired altitude and never change their pitch whatsoever during long haul flights as would be necessary over concave or convex Earths."
11,EPIC Flat Earth Interview,"The oldest and largest secret society in existence (Freemasonry) has a secret so huge and well-hidden, so contrary to what we have been taught to believe, that its exposure threatens to not only completely and single-handedly crush their New World Order “United Nations"" but to radically reshape the entirety of modern academia, universities, the mainstream / alternative medias, all the world’s governments, space agencies, and the very Earth beneath our feet.

12,Flat Earth Enlightenment From Lighthouses,"The distance from which
various lighthouse lights around the world are visible at sea far exceeds what
could be found on a globe Earth 25,000 miles in circumference. For example, the Dunkerque Light in Northern
France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from 28 miles away. Spherical trigonometry dictates that if the
Earth was a globe with the given curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, this
light should be hidden 190 feet below the horizon! The Port Nicholson Light in New Zealand is 420 feet above sea-level
and visible from 35 miles away which means it should be 220 feet below the
horizon. The Egerö Light in Norway is
154 feet above high-water and visible from 28 statute miles where it should be
230 feet below the horizon. The Light at
Madras, on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high and visible from 28 miles away,
where it should be 250 feet below the line of sight. The Cordonan Light on the west coast of
France is 207 feet high and visible from 31 miles away, putting it 280 feet
below the line of sight. The light at
Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea-level and visible at 35
miles, where it should be 491 feet below the horizon. And the lighthouse steeple of St. Botolph’s
Parish Church in Boston is 290 feet tall and visible from over 40 miles away,
where it should be hidden a full 800 feet below the horizon! The distance across St. George's Channel, between
Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It
is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a
considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead
Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay. The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44
feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at
an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be
30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet
above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6
miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and
to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by
8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in
Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet.
Hence, if the earth were a globe, the former would always be 316 feet and the
latter 340 feet below the horizon The lights which are exhibited in lighthouses are seen
by navigators at distances at which, according to the scale of the supposed
‘curvature’ given by astronomers, they ought to be many hundreds of feet, in
some cases, down below the line of sight! For instance: the light at Cape
Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40 miles) that, according to theory, it
ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it
absolutely is, in order to be visible! This is a conclusive proof that there is
no ‘curvature,’ on the surface of the sea - ‘the level of the sea,’- ridiculous
though it is to be under the necessity of proving it at all: but it is,
nevertheless, a conclusive proof that the Earth is not a globe.” The Isle of Wight lighthouse in England is 180 feet high and
can be seen up to 42 miles away, a distance at which modern astronomers say the
light should fall 996 feet below line of sight. The Cape L’Agulhas lighthouse in South Africa is 33 feet high, 238 feet
above sea level, and can be seen for over 50 miles. The Statue of Liberty in New York stands 326
feet above sea level and on a clear day can be seen as far as 60 miles away. The lighthouse at Port Said, Egypt, at an
elevation of only 60 feet has been seen an astonishing 58 miles away, where,
according to modern astronomy it should be 2,182 feet below the line of sight! The distance at which lights can be seen at sea entirely
disposes of the idea that we are living on a huge ball. Another great example is the Notre Dame Antwerp spire
standing 403 feet high from the foot of the tower with Strasburg measuring 468
feet above sea level. With the aid of a
telescope, ships can be distinguished on the horizon and captains declare they
can see the cathedral spire from an amazing 150 miles away. If the Earth were a globe, however, at that
distance the spire should be an entire mile, 5,280 feet below the horizon! In the account of the trigonometrical operations in
France, by M. M. Biot and Arago, it is stated that the light of a powerful
lamp, with good reflectors, was placed on a rocky summit, in Spain, called
Desierto las Palmas, and was distinctly seen from Camprey, on the Island of
Iviza. The elevation of the two points was nearly the same, and the distance
between them nearly 100 miles. If the earth is a globe, the light on the rock
in Spain would have been more than 6600 feet, or nearly one mile and a quarter,
below the line of sight A man named Lietenant-Colonel Portlock used oxy-hydrogen
Drummond’s Lights and heliostats for reflecting the sun’s rays across stations
set up on Precelly, a mountain in South Wales and Kippure, a mountain 10 miles
south-west of Dublin. The instruments
were placed at the same altitude above sea-level and shined across 108 miles of
St. George’s Channel. Technical problems
plagued Portlock’s experiment for weeks, until finally one successful morning
he wrote: “ For five weeks I watched in vain; when, to my joy, the heliostat
blazed out in the early beams of the rising sun, and continued visible as a
bright star the whole day. If the
world were a globe, Portlock’s light should have remained forever invisible
hidden under approximately a mile and a half of Earth’s curvature! If we take a journey down the Chesapeake Bay, by night,
we shall see the ‘light’ exhibited at Sharpe's Island for an hour before the
steamer gets to it. We may take up a position on the deck so that the rail of
the vessel's side will be in a line with the ‘light’ and in the line of sight;
and we shall find that in the whole journey the light won't vary in the
slightest degree in its apparent elevation. But, say that a distance of
thirteen miles has been traversed, the astronomers' theory of ‘curvature’
demands a difference (one way or the other!) in the apparent elevation of the
light, of 112 feet 8 inches! Since, however, there is not a difference of 100
hair's breadths, we have a plain proof that the water of the Chesapeake Bay is
not curved, which is a proof that the Earth is not a globe. We are fairly entitled to conclude, therefore, from the
reliable data furnished as to how far lights at sea can be seen, that the world
is an extended plane, and not the globe of astronomical speculation."
13,How YouTube Censors Flat Earth Videos,"Having been the target of constant overt and covert censorship by YouTube for years, the following is my experience and analysis of how YouTube is actively suppressing and banning legitimate flat Earth content, while allowing and promoting illegitimate disinformation and controlled opposition agents. Since its inception, Google has always prioritized the farcical, satirical ""Flat Earth Society,"" when users search the topic ""Flat Earth"" in their search engine. By doing so, people are introduced to disingenuous disinformation as the primary source of information on the subject and thus influenced into believing the entire topic to be unscientific and just some convoluted troll. Before 2015 when the Flat Earth keyword began its explosive exponential growth, many of my Flat Earth videos went viral, appearing in recommended feeds and given top priority in all relevant searches, garnering millions of views and tens of thousands of subscribers in a very short space of time. Since approximately 2016 and onward however, YouTube has completely changed their algorithm so that a search for ""Flat Earth"" and related topics gives results that show only ""Flat Earth Debunking"" videos for the first several pages! No videos by any legitimate flat Earther appear in the search nor do they make it to recommended feeds. If any user scrolls down through the wall of sophist debunking videos they will then be met with a second wall of disingenuous government Metatron corporate infiltrators, and not a single legitimate scientific Flat Earth video. In order to influence public opinion and the recommended feed algorithm which involves a video's like ratio, YouTube has also engaged in a campaign against myself and other genuine flat Earth content creators by egregiously removing all likes and the ability to like our videos! Not only will thousands of likes disappear and reset to 0 overnight, but users previous likes will remain in the ""like"" position without being counted, while users trying to add new likes are disabled. Meanwhile, however, all dislikes and the ability to dislike remain untouched, making it appear that the public consensus of each video is abysmal and making it impossible to appear in YouTube's recommended feed. Several times and now as if on cue, when a new video on my channel gathers an above average number of views/likes, within 48 hours someone with direct access to YouTube's own software and administrative privileges, wipes all the likes and the ability to like the new video. Every time they have done this, they also wipe the likes from my most recent 10-15 videos for good measure, as if trying to punish me or send some silent message. I assume they could just remove every single like from every video on my account if they wanted, but for whatever reason, they just do it periodically to groups of new videos like this. An even more sinister and effective covert form of censorship YouTube has been engaging in with mine and other legitimate flat Earth channels is removing subscriptions. Over the years I have received thousands of comments from users complaining of being unsubscribed from my channel not once but repeatedly. Many long-time subscribers have complained of being mysteriously unsubscribed from my channel upwards of 5-10 times periodically over the course of several years. Through no action of their own, after noticing a lack of my content appearing in their feeds, users continue commenting that my channel has disappeared from their subscription list. As with removing likes, removing subscriptions makes it incredibly difficult to build a channel, unlikely to appear high in searches, and influences public opinion about the authority and popularity of the content in question. This act of removing likes and subscribers from content creators implicates YouTube themselves in the organized, intentional, unlawful censorship of selected channels, in direct violation of the first amendment rights guaranteed in their country of operation. Channels who attempt using YouTube's live hangout feature encounter another method of covert censorship, whereby people with access to YouTube's administrative dashboard are hacking into live video streams and shutting them down, taking them over and streaming their own anti-flat-Earth content, or playing hard-core pornography on the stream resulting in the channel owner having their account irrevocably striked (and I stipulate irrevocably, because all appeals are denied without reason or explanation). Legitimate, independent, scientific channels like ""Beyond the Imaginary Curve"" are constantly sniped and porn-bombed during their live hangouts, while illegitimate, unscientific, Metatron corporate infiltrators like a certain cold potato channel that shall remain nameless are never affected, nor do they ever have their likes and subscriptions removed. Quite to the contrary, they are prioritized over all other better, genuine content. When all else fails, YouTube simply bans your channel, as myself and several other flat Earthers such as ODD TV, IHateMainStream, Mary at Sea Level, TheSeattleGreen, LukeDoughNelly, Jay Decasby, and many others have experienced. On December 12, 2017, in a particularly outrageous case, in violation of their own community guidelines, YouTube removed my original channel of 7+ years, 135,000 subscribers and 28 million views for a single ""hate-speech"" strike. Firstly there was no hateful speech anywhere in the factual, historical documentary they striked, but secondly and more importantly, they deleted my entire channel of over 200 videos, for a single strike, when their own legal terms and conditions, along with every user's channel dashboard states, that channels are allowed 3 strikes before being banned. Just as with the sniping and porn-bombing attacks, strike and banishment appeals are denied and met with silence no matter how you try to contact YouTube for answers. YouTube has long been engaging in this blatant censorship of flat Earth and many other important topics and it is high time this becomes publicized so they are held accountable for their unlawful actions. Please help share this video across your social media platforms to spread the word about YouTube's under-handed suppression of selected users and subjects. Also be sure to follow on BitTube, DTube, BitChute, Real.Video and other independent video sharing sites where your likes, subscriptions and channels won't be so callously censored. Since we cannot rely on YouTube's algorithms, searches, or recommended videos, it is up to us and of paramount importance that we manually share this information by word of mouth and grassroots activism, so I implore everyone take it upon yourselves and make it your life's mission as myself and many other have to expose these lies/liars and fight for the truth so ourselves and future generations can live in a world where basic liberties like free speech are prized and protected."

15,The Earth Plane,"The Earth Plane is a full-color illustrated science adventure story that follows a young boy and his grandfather through a series of scientific experiments and expeditions ending in an incredible discovery that our world is not at all what we have been taught! When I was your age, growing up in the country, on clear Summer nights grandpa and I would lay on the grass watching the stars. My favorite was Polaris, the bright North Pole Star, positioned perfectly central amidst the constantly circling constellations, like a noble king on his throne, proudly presiding over his twinkling kingdom. Grandpa taught me all 88 constellations from Andromeda to Vulpecula and we would watch them for hours while he told incredible ancient fairy tales of heroes like Hercules and his 12 labors, the prodigal Sun's journey through the 12 houses of the zodiac. On the last night of summer vacation, grandpa and I were staring at the stars when he pointed up and said, ""Polaris, my boy, sits directly above the North Pole, which means the exact center-point of Earth and the exact center-point of the heavens are perfectly aligned. Polaris is like God's eye in the sky watching over his creation and the other stars reaching out at different angles are like his angels bringing light to even the darkest corners of the world. The North Pole is like the base of a gigantic celestial tree reaching to heaven with Polaris its highest leaf, on the tallest branch, directly above the trunk. The other stars are like all the other leaves on all the other branches, and every day the great tree in heaven makes one circle in the sky around its trunk, just like every year every tree on Earth grows a new circle around its trunk."" Our first day back to school started the next morning with the bell ringing and my new teacher Mr. Tyson spinning a large globe on his desk. ""Tell me students, what shape is the Earth?"" he asked, looking at us over the top of his glasses. I glanced around to see if anyone would answer, but everyone was expressionless gawking at the spinning globe like a hypnotist's swinging pocket-watch. ""Anyone,"" he asked again, ""what shape is the Earth?"" Looking out the window at the perfectly flat horizon I remembered flying in my grandpa's airplane and seeing the same flat horizon all around me then. In a moment of confident excitement I raised my hand and exclaimed, ""the Earth is flat!"" Mr. Tyson quickly swung his head around, squinted his eyes at me for a second, then burst out laughing so hard that all the other students couldn't help but join in. Embarrassed and confused, I slumped back and crossed my arms. When everyone finally stopped laughing, Mr. Tyson said, ""Silly boy, the Earth only looks flat because it is so big and you are so small! Imagine an ant on a basketball. For him the horizon would seem flat even though he is really on a ball. Earth is like a spinning basketball and you are like an ant standing on its surface."" Mr. Tyson walked to the blackboard and drew a solar system diagram as he continued explaining. ""Not only does the Earth spin 1,000 miles per hour around its axis, Earth also spins 67,000 miles per hour around the Sun. Meanwhile the Sun, Earth and every planet in our solar system is already spinning 500,000 miles per hour around our corner of the Milky Way galaxy, while the entire Milky Way galaxy is shooting off millions more miles per hour away from the Big Bang explosion which created the universe!"" Walking home from school, I couldn't stop thinking about what Mr. Tyson had said. If Earth was really a big ball spinning around itself, rotating around the Sun, revolving around the galaxy, and shooting off through the universe, then why does the North Pole star never move!? Why haven't the constellations ever changed position or shape in thousands of years!? Night after night, year after year, grandpa and I watched Polaris appear in the exact same spot while all the other stars and constellations always maintained their relative positions to each other. If Earth was really traveling several millions of miles per hour in several different directions, why could we watch every star in the sky making perfect circles around Polaris? If Earth was really traveling many millions of miles per hour in various directions, the star-trails grandpa and I often photographed should have shown irregular spiral shapes, not perfect circles. Upon arriving home, grandpa could see the distress on my face and asked what was wrong. I dropped my book bag to the floor and yelled, ""Mr. Tyson said Earth is a spinning space-ball!"" Grandpa and grandma suddenly both burst out laughing so hard that I couldn't help but join in. ""Oh, well then, don't fall off the bottom of the ball, dear!"" grandma said wiping tears from under her glasses, ""and don't get motion sick from all that spinning, my boy!"" added grandpa slapping his knee. That evening we laid awake long past my bedtime star-gazing. ""It doesn't make sense grandpa,"" I said, becoming increasingly frustrated, ""how can the constellations never change if we're flying millions of miles per hour in several different directions through the universe!? If that's really true then the night sky should look different every single night!"" ""You're absolutely right, my boy."" Grandpa sighed and his usually jovial face turned serious. ""I'm going to tell you a secret now; the world's biggest secret. Very few people in their lifetimes ever get to know this incredible secret, and the few who do, are usually forced to keep it to themselves. The secret is actually something plainly obvious for everyone to see, but when you try telling people, they just scoff and call you crazy. That is how this incredible but obvious secret has been kept so well hidden in plain-sight for nearly 500 years."" ""From the beginning of recorded history, and for thousands upon thousands of years, every ancient culture around the world knew for a fact that Earth was NOT a spinning space-ball. They knew from observation, experimentation, and common sense that Earth is a motionless level plane and that the Sun, Moon, and stars all revolve over and around us. They knew the North Pole to be the magnetic mono-pole center-point of Earth with Polaris, the North Pole star positioned directly above. They knew, just as you do from years of sky-watching, that Polaris is the only motionless star in the heavens, while all the other constellations revolve perfect circles around it."" The next day at school, Mr. Tyson continued explaining his version of the universe. In the middle of the blackboard he drew a huge circle to represent the Sun with nine smaller circles of various sizes to represent the ""planets."" The ""planets,"" he said, were spinning space-balls similar to Earth, and Earth was in fact the third planet from the Sun. He then showed us a colorful poster with beautiful images of each one. ""Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto all revolve around the Sun,"" Mr. Tyson said. ""The Earth spinning around itself causes day and night, while rotating and wobbling around the Sun causes seasons."" ""Wait a minute,"" I said loudly with a sudden burst of confidence, ""my grandpa and I watch the stars and often see Mercury and Venus shining bright all night long, but for your diagram to be true, someone on Earth should only ever see Mercury or Venus during the daytime."" Mr. Tyson glared at me without blinking or speaking and slowly raised an eyebrow. The other children murmured then went silent. ""See,"" I continued, ""if Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than Earth, then we could only ever see them while the Sun is out! It would be impossible to see them at night because Earth is facing the wrong way!"" Mr. Tyson finally blinked, lowered his eyebrow, then turned back to the blackboard and continued his lecture. He completely ignored my objection and just carried on as though my revelation was irrelevant! Discouraged but not dissuaded, I knew he could pretend nothing happened, but I'd found a fatal flaw in his model, and this was just the beginning! That evening after dinner grandpa set up his telescope in the backyard and called me out to sit with him, asking with a cheeky grin, ""What new non-sense did they teach you today, my boy?"" ""Mr. Tyson showed us a poster with pictures of planets and said all the other planets are spheres so Earth must also be a sphere."" Grandpa's grin stretched to his ears. ""Well that's just silly, isn't it? Basketballs are spheres, but that doesn't mean the court is a sphere. Billiard balls are spheres, but that doesn't make the table a sphere. To begin with, you know something is wrong when you ask the shape of the floor and someone immediately looks up to the ceiling for answers! Moreover, Earth is not a 'planet.' Earth is a 'plane' which means level or flat. They just added a 't' to the end of our Earth plane then started calling it a ball! Have a look here."" Grandpa motioned for me to look through the telescope at a bright, blinking, twinkling, clearly circular, but NOT spherical, yellowish star. ""That, my boy, is the 'planet' Venus..."" Grandpa nodded, ""They can make fancy believable pictures using computers nowadays, but they can't stop us from using our own eyes to see the truth. Venus used to be called the 'Morning Star' since it is often seen rising in the East before dawn. In fact all the so-called 'planets' were known to the ancients as 'wandering stars,' because they differ from the other fixed stars in their relative motions only, each making its own unique flower-petal-like pattern over the Earth. As you can see, all the stars and so-called 'planets' are just immaterial lights in the sky. They are not gigantic burning balls of gas, spherical Earth-like realms capable of stepping foot on, nor are they millions and millions of miles away, but rather quite close as evidenced by the amount of detail seen using a mere 83x zoom telescope."" As usual, none of the other students spoke up so I quickly raised my hand thinking the answer was obvious. ""They are the same size. Anyone can see that!"" ""Wrong again, silly boy!"" Mr. Tyson laughed to himself, ""the Sun is actually 400 times larger than the Moon. It only looks the same size as the Moon because it is also 400 times further away from Earth."" Dumbfounded, I blurted back, ""You want me to believe the flat horizon I see in front of me is actually curved, the motionless Earth I feel beneath me is actually moving, and the two equal-sized circles I see above me are actually 400 times different size!? Just how far away do you think the Sun is, Mr Tyson?"" ""The Sun is approximately 93 million miles away from Earth,"" he said with a slowblink and roll of the eyes. ""How could you or anyone else possibly know if no one has ever traveled 93 million miles to prove it!?"" I asked with wide-eyed excitement. ""Complex mathematical formulas and calculations perfected over centuries by astrophysicists and people much smarter than a pesky little school-boy, that's how!"" That afternoon upon hearing what Mr. Tyson taught us, grandpa immediately loaded his truck and brought me to the beach. The Sun was shining brightly through a few clouds casting its rays downwards and outwards onto the water like a sparkling pyramid of light. ""Those are called crepuscular rays,"" grandpa explained. ""If you trace the beams of light up past the clouds they all converge at the Sun, just like if you traced back the beams diverging from a flashlight they all converge back to its source. So what do you think? Does it look 93 million miles away to you?"" Grandpa smiled as I squinted my eyes and shook my head. ""Even Copernicus, the creator of this whole solar-system cosmology, claimed the Sun was only 3,391,200 miles away based on his expert calculations. The next century, his successor Kepler claimed the Sun was actually 12,376,800 miles away based on his even more expert calculations. Sir Issac Newton in the next century was quoted saying, 'it matters not whether we reckon it 28 or 54 million miles distant for either would do just as well.' So you can see just how 'scientific' these socalled scientists were with their calculations, and nothing has changed since then. Over the centuries, using their mathe-magic, they have continued furthering the Sun's supposed distance to today's current most-expert, super-pseudo-scientific figure of 93 million miles."" Grandpa grabbed a duffel bag out of his truck and we made our way towards the shore-line. ""You see, they can make internally-consistent, mathematically-correct formulas showing the Sun to be a billion miles away if they want to, but that doesn't make it reality. Real science must be observable, testable, and repeatable so that everyone can experiment and conclude for themselves, and that's just what we're going to do."" Grandpa pulled a large metal astronomical instrument out of the bag and placed it in my hands. ""This is called a 'sextant,' and it is used to calculate the exact angular distances of objects like the Sun, Moon and stars."" He placed his hands over mine and held the eye-piece up so I could see through it. ""First we align with the horizon, press the clamp to release the index bar, then bring the Sun to the horizon line and read the angle. This is how sailors have long used stars to navigate the seas and how we can know the Sun is not millions of miles away! By taking angular measurements in two different locations at the same time of day, then factoring the straight-line distance between the two locations, we have two exact angles and one exact side of a triangle from which we can use the Pythagorean theorem to accurately factor the distance to the Sun. Navigators for centuries have used this method and determined the Sun and Moon to both be only approximately 30 miles in diameter, and less than 3000 miles away from the Earth."" As we laid together on the beach, the Sun began setting casting hues of red, orange and yellow over the sky. I crossed my arms behind my head and asked, ""Grandpa, why does the sky change color at sunrise and sunset?"" Grandpa smiled, sat up and pointed to a row of street lights in the parking lot, ""See how each distant light looks like it's getting lower and closer to the ground than the previous one?"" I noticed and nodded my head. ""In reality, all of those street lights are exactly the same height and only appear to sink towards the horizon due to how our eyes perceive perspective. Likewise, the Sun never actually rises at sunrise and never really sets at sunset! At dawn and dusk, the Sun is much farther away from our position than at midday, so from our perspective it appears to be rising and setting, but is really just coming and going. Now when the Sun is farther away, its light rays have to move through more molecules of air before reaching our eyes. This makes shorter wavelength colors, like blue, scatter off in different directions, leaving the longest wavelength colors, like red and orange, to hit your eyes and create these beautiful scenes."" As the Sun half-disappeared beyond the horizon, Grandpa set up his video camera then called me over. ""See here, my boy, the Sun looks like it's sinking below the horizon, but by zooming-in we can prove it's really just moving away from us."" As the camera zoomed, the half-disappeared Sun became entirely visible again, then as it zoomed further, the Sun rose higher and higher back into the sky. ""You can do it with ships beyond the horizon too,"" Grandpa said pointing to a boat far off in the distance. ""Watch as this one appears to sink hull-first into the horizon. Pseudo-scientists like your teacher Mr. Tyson have said for centuries that this is somehow proof that you are living on a ball. They say the horizon is the curvature of their ball-Earth and when ships or the Sun move beyond it, that they have literally sunk beneath the ball! If that was true then we could never zoom them back into view, but look here; that ship has now completely disappeared from view of our naked eyes, yet with this newfangled technology, we can zoom the entire ship fully back into view, proving the horizon is not the curvature of their ball-Earth, but rather just the vanishing line of your perspective."" Chuckling, he answered, ""'Pseudo' means fake or false. A 'scientist,' is anyone who uses observation and experimentation to formulate logical conclusions about the natural world. So a 'pseudo-scientist' is a fake scientist, or someone who denies actual observation and experimentation in favor of fairy-tale theories. You and I are real scientists, my boy!"" grandpa exclaimed taking a long spirit-level from his truck and setting it upon a nearby beach-side railing. ""The pseudo-scientists say Earth is a big ball 3,963 miles in radius so we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to calculate the curvature that should exist according to them, which turns out to be 8 inches per mile squared. This means after 2 miles the Earth should curve 32 inches, after 3 miles 72 inches, and after 10 miles (the width of this here cove) the Earth should curve downwards a full 66 feet! Line your eyes up behind this railing and see for yourself. Does the horizon dip?"" ""Of course not,"" grandpa smiled, ""you will never see a curved horizon or curved water. It's called the 'horizon' for good reason, because it's always perfectly 'horizon'tal, and it's called 'sea-level,' because bodies of water at rest are always perfectly level. Whether it's in a beaker, a bottle, a bathtub, a pond, a lake or an ocean, the natural physics of water and other liquids is to find and remain level. 70% of the world is covered in level water, so how could Earth not be flat? The idea that our level oceans are somehow curved around and stuck to the underside of a spinning space-ball is the greatest deception in the history of mankind!"" School started the next morning with the bell ringing and Mr. Tyson dropping his microphone. ""Why did the microphone fall to the floor? Anyone?"" he asked, looking around the room. When satisfied no one would answer, he continued, ""It fell because of 'gravity,' a force created by large masses that causes other smaller masses to stick to them like a magnet. Because the Earth is so massive, it creates a gravitational pull which sucked the microphone down to the floor. This gravity is what keeps people, buildings, oceans and everything else stuck to our globe. Has anyone ever heard of Australia being called, 'the land down under?'"" A few students raised their hands as Mr. Tyson picked the globe off his desk and pointed underneath it. ""As you can see, Australia is literally a 'land down under' the globe, and 'gravity' is what keeps Australians from falling off the bottom of Earth!"" The class erupted in laughter as I sat quietly pondering the absurdity of Australians all upside-down being constantly sucked to the center of a globe so they wouldn't fall off. How could gravity be so strong that it keeps people, buildings and entire oceans stuck to the underside of a spinning globe, yet weak enough that smoke and steam, tiny birds and bugs can escape its grasp, and rise or fly with ease? How could gravity be so strong that it curves and holds the oceans onto a ball, yet weak enough that it doesn't cause even a lilypad or floating leaf to sink? Mr. Tyson drew a large, medium and small circle on the blackboard to represent the Sun, Earth and Moon, then continued his explanation. ""The Sun is the most massive object in our solar system so it creates the biggest gravitational pull. The Earth is smaller than the Sun, but larger than the Moon, so gravity causes the Earth to orbit around the Sun, while causing the Moon to orbit the Earth."" ""Wait a minute!"" I quickly raised my hand and interrupted. ""Before you said gravity caused smaller masses to stick to larger masses. Now you're saying it causes smaller masses to orbit around larger masses! Which one is it, Mr. Tyson? And how does gravity decide when to spin things in circles and when to suck things like a magnet!?"" When I got home from school and told grandpa all about ""gravity"" he insisted it was time for us to take another field-trip. After grabbing a big bucket and globe from his shed, we headed out to the city center, stopping just out front the United Nations building where there stood a large stone fountain shaped like a map of the world. In the very middle positioned at the North Pole was a flag pole flying the UN flag. ""Sometimes the truth is most easily hidden in plain sight,"" grandpa said. ""This here flag and fountain show a more true map and model of Earth than anything they're teaching you in school, my boy. The fountain water representing the oceans at sealevel is fully contained and lays perfectly flat. Meanwhile the continents protrude up from sea-level giving us a practical, tactile, working model of Earth's land and water."" ""Now compare that with this,"" grandpa said holding his globe in one hand and a bucket full of fountain water in the other. He then poured the water over the globe and we watched as every last drop fell back to the fountain below. ""Water must be contained like in this bucket or in this fountain, and will stay within and conform to the interior shape of its container. However, water will never stick to or conform to the exterior of shapes like this globe. No matter how big the globe is, water will always fall off and people will be unable to stand anywhere but on top. Even Spaceship Earth at Disney's Epcot Center, 18 stories tall and 16 million pounds, the largest geodesic sphere ever constructed, cannot create one iota of its own 'gravity,' or cause even a golf ball to stick to or orbit around it. You see, this theoretical force that sucks everything towards the center of large masses was needed to explain how water could bend around a ballEarth and keep people from falling off the bottom. The problem is, for a theory to be proven, it must be observable, measurable, repeatable, and scalable. Yet, after 400 years since Newton's theory, bendy water nor this magical sucking force is anywhere observable, measurable or repeatable, and even the largest-scale sphere ever constructed fails to behave as they claim their spherical Earth does. It's quite convenient to claim the natural physics of water somehow changes at a scale too large to recreate, but it's not science."" ""Long before the theory of gravity was a glimmer in Newton's imagination, the natural physics of density and buoyancy already perfectly explained why apples fall down. Quite simply, objects fall or rise based on their relative density to the medium surrounding them. Apples fall because they are denser than the air, while helium balloons rise because they are lighter - no 'gravity' necessary. This is why raindrops fall down through the air and air-bubbles rise up through water! Everything seeks its relative density and rises or falls until settling accordingly. This is why a tiny pebble sinks to the bottom of the ocean, but gigantic cruise-ships and aircraft carriers stay afloat on the surface, because even though a pebble is so small, its mass relative to its volume (its density) is more than water, so it sinks, and even though a cruise-ship is so large, its mass relative to its volume is less than water, so it floats. If Newton's apple had landed in a puddle instead of on his head, he would have seen the apple only fell through the air because it was denser than the air, but then floated on top of the water because it was less dense than water. Have you ever noticed how it’s easier to stay afloat with your lungs full of air than it is when they're empty? Submarines float on the surface when their ballast tanks are filled with air, but when the vents are opened and seawater floods in, they begin to sink as the submarine's density becomes greater than water. Depending what depth they wish to dive, sailors simply adjust the ratio of air/water in the tanks, and when ready to re-surface they blow compressed air into the tanks forcing the seawater out, lowering the density, and thus causing them to rise back to the surface. We can also prove this fact of relative density by filling a balloon with approximately half helium and half air. Since helium is lighter than the oxygen, nitrogen and other gases that compose the air around us, filling a balloon with just the right amount of helium to compensate for and balance out the density of the plastic results in a 'gravity-defying' levitating balloon at equilibrium that neither rises nor falls!"" ""Come on down, my boy!"" grandpa said, waving me toward the docks. ""Not only do submarines prove gravity doesn't exist, they prove the oceans are flat too!"" Grandpa saluted a naval officer and led me aboard the largest submarine I had ever seen. We entered the control room and grandpa pointed out several maps and charts laying on the table. ""Ship captains in navigating great distances at sea never need to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their calculations. Both Plane Sailing and Great Circle Sailing, the most popular navigation methods, use plane, not spherical trigonometry, making all mathematical calculations on the assumption that the oceans are completely flat. If the Earth were in fact a sphere, such an errant assumption would lead to constant glaring inaccuracies, but in fact plane navigation methods have worked perfectly in theory and practice for thousands of years."" ""Have a look through these,"" grandpa said excitedly pulling down two periscopes. ""Regular observational periscopes are able to see ships about 7 or 8 miles away, while special targeting periscopes equipped with high-tech zoom capability can see ships twice or thrice as far where they should be invisible blocked beneath hundreds of feet of Earth's alleged curvature. Submarines set their depth below sea-level then travel for distances of hundreds or thousands of miles without changing their inclination whatsoever. If the Earth were truly a sphere, however, submarines would have to periodically dip their noses downward every few miles to maintain the same depth, otherwise they would always be accidentally re-surfacing due to the ocean's curvature!"" Grandpa grabbed my hand and led me through the torpedo and sonar rooms. ""Subs are equipped with long-range torpedoes such as the Blackshark and F21 which can hit straightline targets over 30 miles away, but if the Earth were truly a globe of given proportions, these torpedo targets would be hidden behind a 600 foot wall of curved Earth. Modern Navy rail guns now have the ability to bulls-eye straight-line targets 120 miles away! Yet on a globeEarth of given proportions, such targets would be blocked by 9600 feet, or over a mile and a half of curvature. Last but not least, sonar arrays on the bow, stern, port and starboard send and receive radar signals in all directions, active sonar to about 30 miles and passive sonar up to an incredible 1000 miles! On a globe-Earth of given proportions, these sonar signals should be undetectable hidden by over 100 miles of supposed curvature."" Back at school the next day, my brain reeling from the week's revelations, Mr. Tyson wheeled in a television for us to watch a cosmos documentary showing beautiful pictures and videos of the Earth, Sun, Moon, stars and planets all shaped like multicolored billiard balls spinning around, satellites, telescopes, space stations, and astronauts free-floating in outer-space, remote-controlled rovers on Mars, even men walking, jumping, go-karting and golfing on the Moon. While the other students sat mesmerized cooing ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"" at every new image, I kept thinking about something my grandpa once said about pink unicorns: ""If I told you I had pink unicorns in my shed, would you believe me?"" he asked. I shook my head. ""You wouldn't and shouldn't believe me because people can lie. If I showed you pictures of some pink unicorns in my shed, would you believe me then?"" I shook my head again. ""You still wouldn't and shouldn't believe me because pictures can be faked. What if I showed you high-definition videos of pink unicorns in my shed, then would you believe?"" I shook my head once again. ""You still wouldn't and shouldn't believe me because videos too can be faked!"" Grandpa's point was we shouldn't just believe second-hand information and should confirm and experience everything for ourselves first-hand. Then we know the truth rather than just believe, and as grandpa always said, ""belief is just a substitute for knowing."" With his words echoing through my head, I began noticing how fake the beautiful pictures of Earth were, how they were clearly computer-generated images and not actual photographs. The color, size and shape of the land and water masses differed so drastically between pictures that they couldn't possibly be real. The more critically I examined the supposed pictures of Earth from space, the more they reminded me of grandpa's pink unicorns. ""Have a look at this, my boy!"" Grandpa called me into the study and pointed to his computer screen. The same footage I had seen at school of men on the Moon was playing, only this time with the speed doubled. My jaw slowly dropped as it became clear the astronauts were actually walking, jumping, go-karting and golfing on Earth, but edited at half-speed to give a ""low-gravity"" illusion! ""Now watch this,"" grandpa said clicking forward to several short scenes where we could clearly see overhead wires attached to the astronaut's backpacks! ""They even used the same backdrops over and over,"" grandpa said showing me video and photo overlays of the exact same hills, dunes and craters appearing at supposedly different locations on the ""Moon."" There were also clear dividing lines on the floor between the foreground and backdrops, lens flares and diverging shadows from multiple light sources, even overhead spotlights reflecting off astronaut's visors, all proving the footage was filmed in a studio. ""We can expose their photo-trickery now using Photoshop,"" grandpa said opening several of NASA's official photographs of Earth taken from the Moon. ""Just adjust the brightness and contrast levels a bit and look what happens!"" As grandpa increased the brightness and lowered the contrast, rectangular artifacts suddenly appeared around the ""Earth"" proving them to be doctored images cut and pasted into place. Other pictures we adjusted showed shadows being cast onto the blackness of ""space,"" again proving they were in a room with black walls/ceilings, and not actually on the Moon. ""Now look at these cloud patterns,"" grandpa said pointing to NASA's Blue Marble Earth picture, ""what do you notice?"" At first nothing, but then it became all I could see: the same cloud patterns were at several places all over the Earth! Not similar cloud patterns, but the exact same clouds copied and pasted into place! ""I'll tell you what my boy,"" grandpa said tapping his temple, ""the only thing NASA ever sent to space is our imagination."" Grandpa pointed out the office window to the afternoon waxing gibbous Moon. ""Notice how you can see the blue sky right through it? That's because the Moon is not a solid, opaque, dirt-ball capable of stepping foot on; it is merely a translucent luminary, a light. For centuries confused establishment astronomers have written about seeing stars and planets clearly shining right through the dark body of waxing and waning Moons. In fact, a star occulting the crescent Moon has long been a popular symbol of Islam and is found on national flags from Algeria and Pakistan to Singapore, Tunisia, and Turkey. These same confused astronomical experts tell us the Moon has no light of its own and simply reflects the Sun's light, but this is also provably incorrect as the two lights have altogether different and opposing properties. For example, the Sun’s light is golden, warm, drying, preservative, antiseptic, decreases fire combustion, and prevents plant and animal substances from decomposition, while the Moon’s light is silver, cool, damp, putrefying, septic, increases fire combustion and causes plant and animal substances to decay. These two very different and opposing effects cannot be the result of mere reflection, however, and prove that the Sun and Moon both shine with their own unique lights."" Later that evening grandpa and I set-up an experiment to test if moon-light really was cold. We placed a glass of water in direct moon-light and another in the moon-shade, then used digital thermometers to record both the air and water temperatures in moonlight vs. moon-shade. For the entire night both the moon-light air and water remained between one and two full degrees colder than the air and water in moon-shade. ""If done during a full-moon the results are greater,"" grandpa said, ""but this should suffice to prove the Moon produces its own cool light. Astronomers claim the Moon is a solid spherical body that reflects sun-light, but the fact is reflectors must be flat or concave for light rays to have any angle of incidence; If the reflector's surface is convex then every ray of light points in a direct line with the radius perpendicular to the surface resulting in no reflection. So, in other words, it's impossible that man has ever or could ever set foot on the Moon because it's not terra firma like Earth, but rather a luminary, like the Sun, shining with its own unique light."" The next morning marked the start of a long weekend and grandpa woke me early from a sound sleep saying, ""We're going on an epic adventure, my boy!"" Grandma had my bags already packed in the truck with breakfast-to-go and waved goodbye as we sped off towards the airport. Upon arrival, grandpa was greeted with warm smiles, salutes, and good mornings from all the pilots we walked past. ""Today, we're going to see for ourselves and prove the Earth plane with my Earth Plane!"" grandpa exclaimed proudly pointing to the tail of his single-engine open-cockpit plane. ""I named her 'The Earth Plane' for the double-meaning,"" he said grinning. ""Why do you think they're called air'planes' and not air-planets or air-globes? Because they're not flying over a 'planet' or a 'globe,' they're flying over a plane!"" We climbed in the cockpit, geared-up, strapped in, and prepared for take-off. As we picked up speed, grandpa yelled for me to pay attention to the horizon and not take my eyes off it. We lifted from the runway and watched the horizon slowly rising up with us and extending outwards further and further the higher we went. ""Keep watching!"" grandpa yelled as he pulled back the yoke and we continued to climb higher and higher. The horizon kept rising right along with us remaining perfectly flat and level 360 degrees around. ""We're almost at maximum height now,"" grandpa said still pulling back the yoke when suddenly the engine stalled, everything went silent, and the plane started to nose-dive! ""Uh oh!"" grandpa said fumbling at the controls. Just as I began to panic, I saw a thin smile cross grandpa's lips, then he restarted the engine, leveled the plane again, turned to me and winked. When we landed grandpa explained, ""if the horizon was actually the curvature of a globe, no matter how large, it would remain at a fixed height, and we would have to gradually tilt our heads down more the higher we ascended to view it. In reality, however, no matter how high you go, the horizon rises right with your eyes and remains flat. In fact, amateur balloons with cameras have been sent 10 times higher than we just went, over 120,000 feet or 20 miles up, and the flat horizon rises all the way up. The only time you'll ever see a curved horizon is through fish-eyed lenses or curved commercial airplane windows."" After finishing our hot chocolate, grandpa handed me a small spirit-level and we headed back to the Earth Plane for another experiment. Pointing at the instrument panel, he said, ""this is called an attitude indicator or an artificial horizon; it uses a gyroscope to track the pilot's orientation relative to Earth's horizon. So when we lift-off and start gaining altitude, the indicator will pitch up and the bubble in your spirit-level will rise forward away from you. Once we reach cruising altitude, I will level the plane, and both the artificial horizon and your spirit-level will confirm this. We will continue to fly perfectly straight and level due south all night long, then tomorrow morning I will decrease altitude, the indicator will pitch down and the bubble in your spirit-level will fall backward towards you until landing then level off again. If we were really flying over a globe and not a level plane Earth I would have to regularly dip the nose decreasing altitude to compensate for the globe's curvature or else would find myself regularly gaining altitude simply by flying level! This is absurd, as no pilot in history has ever experienced gaining altitude by simply flying level, but this is what must happen if we lived on a globe!"" Grandpa grabbed a pen and paper to help explain. First he drew a big circle to represent the globe, then he made a straight line tangent to it to represent the path of a plane flying level, and lastly put several straight dotted vertical lines perpendicular to the tangent showing the exponential gain in altitude that should occur if we were really flying over a globe. ""If Earth is a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, and we fly over it level at 200mph, in 30 minutes Earth should curve downwards over a mile; and in an hour, we should find ourselves nearly 5 miles higher altitude than we started simply by flying perfectly level! Let's see what really happens."" Grandpa fastened the spirit-level next to my seat, patted me on the head and jumped into the cockpit. As we took off, the bubble in my spirit-level rose forward and the gyro-horizon pitched up, just like grandpa said. Then we reached cruising altitude and grandpa leveled off the plane bringing the bubble, real and artificial horizons all back to the center where they remained for hours until I finally fell asleep. The next morning when I woke up, after traveling thousands of miles, we were still flying level and at the exact same altitude proving Earth couldn't possibly be a globe curving downwards away from us. ""Can you imagine landing if that runway was really moving 1000 miles per hour!?"" Grandpa chuckled lowering the landing gear. ""If the Earth was really constantly spinning Eastward 1000 miles every hour, it would be impossible for airplanes to land on runways facing all manner of directions North, South, East, West and every way in between."" Grandpa touched-down gently and parked the plane for re-fueling. ""Back in the 18th century, when the hot-air balloon was invented, people asked why, if the Earth was constantly spinning, couldn't they simply hover in place and wait for their Eastward destinations to arrive under them? The pseudo-scientists of their time claimed this was impossible because the magical force of gravity somehow pulled the entire atmosphere and their balloons perfectly along with the Earth! This was and is completely against any science, logic or common sense mind you, but when men of presumed authority make presumptuous authoritative statements, they are rarely questioned. If the Earth and atmosphere were constantly spinning 1000mph Eastwards, this should somewhere somehow be seen, heard, felt or measurable by someone, yet no one in history has ever done so; meanwhile, however, we can hear, feel and experimentally measure even the slightest 1mph Westward breeze. Such non-sensical theories are debunked by clouds, wind, weather patterns, rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning faster than the speed of sound! Seriously, my boy, can you imagine sideways rain falling at the equator, or upside-down planes landing in Australia!?"" Grandpa and I laughed at such a ridiculous thought. ""Around the turn of the 20th century, the ball-Earth pseudo-scientists were conclusively proven wrong upon the invention of the airplane. You see, if the Earth were constantly spinning Eastwards 1000mph at the equator then airplane flight durations Eastwards vs. Westwards would be significantly different. Since the average commercial airliner travels 500mph, it follows that Westbound equatorial flights should reach their destination approximately three times faster than their Eastbound return flights! In reality, however, the differences in East/Westbound flight durations usually amount to a matter of minutes, and nothing near what would occur on a 1000mph spinning ball Earth. For example, commercial flights from Quito, Ecuador traveling Eastwards 2000 miles to Macapa, Brazil, at 500mph, take an average of 4 hours, so the return flights Westward going against the alleged 1000mph spin of the Earth should be significantly shorter, but in reality take the exact same 4 hours, just as expected on a stationary Earth."" That evening we set-up camp in the woods near the airfield, pitched a tent, unrolled our sleeping bags, and roasted marshmallows on a bon-fire. Grandpa was teaching me how to make them golden brown without burning them, when suddenly he went silent and smiled to himself. With a glint in his eye and a s'more in his mouth, grandpa told me about the last time he taught someone the fine art of marshmallow roasting. ""It was your grandmother and I's honeymoon to the Arctic, which we've always called our 'honeysun' because we stayed up all night to watch the never-setting Midnight Sun."" Grandpa swiftly snagged my stick and blew out my blackened failure. ""The Midnight Sun is what you can see in Northern regions above the Arctic circle during and around the Summer Solstice. For several days or even weeks (depending where you are) you can watch the Sun travel 360 degrees around you slowly rising and falling every 12 hours, but never fully setting below the horizon! This is because at the Summer Solstice the Sun reaches its inner-most circuit directly over the Tropic of Cancer, allowing observers situated centrally in the Arctic circle to see the Sun make its complete 24 hour circuit without ever leaving the sky. Your grandmother and I witnessed 3 days without darkness, 72 hours of daylight, which would be impossible on a tilting, wobbling, spinning globe Earth. To see the Sun for an entire revolution on a spinning ball at any point other than the poles, you would have to be looking through miles and miles of land and sea for part of the revolution! Anyone below the poles could never witness the Sun for 72 hours, 3 whole revolutions, straight because to do so would mean you are somehow seeing “through the globe” and to the Sun on the other side! The ball-Earth pseudo-scientists have tried to claim 24 hour sunlight also happens in Antarctica during the Winter Solstice to help bolster their wobbling ball model, but their only supposed evidence is a couple of clearly fake edited videos which have been thoroughly debunked. There is, in fact, never 24 hour sunlight anywhere in Antarctica because even when the Sun reaches its outer-most circuit over the Tropic of Capricorn, the entirety of the Antarctic circumference cannot be reached by its light at any one time, and so it will still set every day. The Royal Belgian Geographical Society even recorded that during the most severe part of the Antarctic winter, from 71 degrees South latitude onwards, the sun sets on May 17th and is not seen above the horizon again until July 21st. This would be impossible on a spinning space-ball wobbling around the Sun, and is yet another proof we live on a motionless level plane with the Sun, Moon and stars all revolving over and around us, just as we experience every day."" After almost another full day of flying, it was getting increasingly colder, and we made our final refueling stop at a lonely place called the Desolation Islands. As we walked along the sparse coastline, grandpa unfolded a huge, detailed map called ""Hammond's Air Age Map of the World,"" and pointed to our location. ""Here at 49 degrees Southern latitude, we're nearing the coldest, harshest, most desolate climate on Earth: Antarctica."" Grandpa traced his finger in a circle around the circumference of the map, then traced two more smaller concentric circles showing the path of the Sun throughout the year. ""During its annual spiral journey over and around the Earth, the Sun slowly speeds up and widens its circular path for 6 months until reaching the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5 degrees South latitude. Then for the next 6 months, the Sun slows down and narrows its path until reaching the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees North latitude. This is why equatorial and tropical regions experience almost year-round summer and heat while higher latitudes North and especially South experience more distinct seasons with harsh winters. Here on the Desolation Islands there are only 18 species of native plants and a handful of animals that can survive the cold, hostile climate, compared to somewhere of equal 49 degrees Northern latitude, like the country of France, which has a very hospitable climate and is home to hundreds of native animals and thousands of native plants. The stark contrast between places of equal latitudes North and South is a direct result of the Sun's influence (or lack of influence) over them. In the North dawn and dusk are usually drawn-out beautiful scenes lasting over an hour each, whereas in the deep South dawn and dusk pass by in an instant, becoming bright as day or too dark to see in a matter of minutes. The Northern Arctic region enjoys moderately warm summers and manageable winters due to the Sun's slower, tighter circles in the North, whereas the Southern Antarctic region never even warms enough to melt the perpetual snow and ice due to the Sun's swifter, wider circles it makes over the South. This results in Antarctica being by far the coldest place on Earth with an average annual temperature of -57 degrees Fahrenheit in contrast to the average at the North Pole, a comparatively warm 4 degrees."" ""So we're going to Antarctica?"" I asked pulling my jacket hood over my sweatshirt hoodie over my ear-muffs over my hat. Early the next morning, after flying all night over rough, dark seas, dawn arrived behind us and illuminated in front of us a huge 200-foot-high plateau of Antarctic ice extending outwards and onward as far as the eye could see. We continued flying south over Antarctica until lunchtime when Grandpa brought us down on a flat patch of ice near the South Pole. ""I'm afraid we don't have clearance to touch down over there, my boy. In fact, the Antarctic Treaty, a law signed by 53 countries and enforced by military, prohibits independent exploration of Antarctica, so if they catch us we'll be in trouble!"" Grandpa winked and handed me a magnetic compass as we walked toward a tall red and white barber-shop pole sticking out of the ice. ""They say this here is the South Pole, but then contradict themselves by saying the true South Pole is actually constantly moving around somewhere in this vicinity. This is just a convenient and necessary excuse to maintain their lie. Because if Earth was really a big ball and we're standing on the bottom of that ball right now at the southern-most point, you should be able to walk in a circle with your back to the Pole and have the compass show North being in front of you in every direction."" I walked a large circle with my back to the South Pole and North remained fixed in the direction we flew from no matter where I went. ""Think about it, if we're on the bottom of a ball right now, how could the compass point North!? North would be the top of the ball, so the needle would have to point down to your feet! North-facing compass needles at the South Pole must be pointing into outer-space!"" Grandpa laughed. ""The truth is they've just placed this red and white barber-shop pole at an arbitrary location here in Antarctica so rich people on their government-approved penguin-tours can get their pictures taken and claim they've been to the 'bottom of the world.' But as you can see from your compass reading, there's plenty more land South of the South Pole that doesn't exist anywhere on the globe!"" We gazed southwards from the South Pole at the massive expanse of mountainous ice ahead of us. ""This land doesn't exist on any known map. It could go on forever for all we know. Perhaps there are other Earth-ponds beyond, or maybe there is some solid barrier like a dome that contains us. I have been wondering and wanting to know what exists South of the South Pole for my whole life. Let's go find out!"" As we climbed back into the Earth Plane preparing for take-off, an emergency message came over the radio accusing us of unauthorized landing in Antarctica, and warning that our craft would be shot down if we didn't turn back immediately! Grandpa sat still for a second, shut his radio off, turned to me and said, ""We'll only get one chance at this, my boy, and we've come too far to go back without any answers!"" Grandpa fired the engine up and we lifted-off heading South at top-speed. Within minutes a group of military jets began tailing us closely and the look on his face changed from nervous excitement to frustrated despair. Our plane's top speed was no match. The jets closed in and began firing warning shots in our direction. Grandpa quickly attempted an evasive maneuver in hopes of losing them but it was useless. Another warning shot came close enough that we could hear it whizzing by our heads, and that was the last straw. With watery eyes grandpa banked 180 degrees and began heading back. The military escort directed us toward the air-strip I'd seen earlier, forced us to land, then arrested grandpa and led him away into a locked windowless room for hours. When he finally came back out, grandpa said since he had also served in the military, they only gave him a slap on the wrist, but could have been penalized with fines and jail-time for what we did. That evening before beginning our long flight back home, grandpa told me something that would change my entire life from that moment forward. Sitting on a couple crates by the tarmac and sharing a meal of rice and beans on paper plates, he turned to me with sad eyes, an upside-down frown, and said, ""you're old enough to know the truth now, my boy. Remember your grandma and I told you how your father was a great pilot and your mother a daring explorer?"" My ears perked up at the rare mention of my parents. ""And how when you were very little, their plane was lost during an expedition?"" I nodded my head. ""I never told you, but I was with them, and the expedition was right here. I was flying solo in the Earth Plane, and your parents were together in your father's identical Earth Plane 2. We all shared a passion for truth and wanted to explore the lands South of the South Pole so we decided to go for it. Just like today, military crafts began tailing us shortly after passing the pole, sending emergency messages over the radio, and firing warning shots. Knowing your father was the better pilot, I drew their fire and led them off due west while your father and mother continued speeding South. Two jets followed me, but another three stayed tailing your parent's plane, and that was when I lost track of them. The last thing I heard was your father's brave voice crackling over the radio adamantly saying, ""we have the right to full exploration of Earth and you have no right to stop us!"" Nobody ever heard from my parents again. There were no news reports, no obituaries, no death certificates, and all official inquiries into the incident were met with denial. Grandpa and I held hope that they succeeded in escaping to undiscovered lands, but it seemed more and more unlikely every year that passed, since if they did survive, surely they would come back home. It has been thirty years since my grandpa took me on that fateful flight. I decided then and there to make it my life's mission to discover the truth, and I wouldn't repeat the same mistakes of my parents and grandparents. A grand conspiracy spanning five centuries, brainwashing the entirety of humanity, and protected by advanced military technology, could not be defeated by a single man. Only if a critical mass became awakened and active in exposing the deception could the truth be known and full exploration achieved. So I set out to make the biggest noise I could about our Earth Plane. I talked about it to everyone I met. I made posters, stickers, signs and stamps, created websites, blogs, documentaries, and articles, posted pictures, videos, memes and maps on forums and social medias. Slowly more and more people began questioning reality, thinking critically, and realizing the lies. I began writing books, doing podcasts, radio interviews, and making music all about our Earth Plane. I even wrote a children's book called, ""The Earth Plane,"" to help our poor youngsters understand how they are being lied to. Finally, I went to school to become a pilot like my father and grandfather, and when I could afford it, bought my very own Earth Plane 3. Now, tens of millions have awakened to the reality of our Earth Plane and they are hard at work spreading the word even further! Humanity is ready for the truth and today we will discover it! Myself and hundreds more pilots and sailors have organized an entire fleet of ""Earth Planes"" and ""Earth Ships"" simultaneously heading South from all longitudes to fully explore Antarctica and beyond! They cannot stop us all, and many members of the military are on our side. They have even promised to give stand-down orders to allow us through undisturbed. Today, is the culmination of my family's brave efforts to free humanity. Today pseudo-science and its minions like Mr. Tyson will fall and the truth will be known to all!"
16,Flat Earth is Not a Conspiracy Theory,"Flat Earth has long been touted as the mother of all conspiracy theories, marginalized, suppressed and ridiculed for centuries as being an ignorant ancient unscientific worldview, but the facts of the matter are far from what you have been told. It is a fact, not a theory, that bodies of water always seek and find their own level, from a beaker, a bottle, or a bathtub, to a pond, lake or an ocean, the natural physics of water and other liquids is to find and remain level. It is an unproven, unscientific theory with no observable, measurable, or repeatable evidence, to claim that bodies of water can somehow bend, cling to the exterior of shapes, and show convexity upon their surface. It is a fact that the majority of Earth is covered in such level water, thus making it an unscientific theory to postulate that Earth is actually a gigantic sphere with bendy oceans curving all the way around it. It is a fact, not a theory, that the horizon always appears perfectly flat 360 degrees around the observer regardless of altitude. All amateur balloon, rocket, plane and drone footage show a completely flat horizon as high as we can reach, over 20 miles, or 120,000 feet up. The only time the horizon ever bends is when viewed through a fish-eye lens or a curved commercial airplane window. It is also a fact, that the horizon always rises to the eye level of the observer as altitude is gained, so you never have to look down to see it. If the Earth were in fact a globe, no matter how large, as you ascended the horizon would stay fixed and the observer would have to tilt looking down further and further to see it. It is a fact, not a theory, that we are able to observe objects at incredibly long distances far beyond what would be possible if Earth were a globe, 25,000 miles in circumference as we're told. For example, it is a fact, that in Genoa, Italy, from just above sea-level, on clear days it is possible to see the distant islands of Elba, Gorgona, Capraia, and Corsica 80-125 miles away. It is a necessary theory that the globe-Earth must curve 8 inches per mile squared if it really be a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, but based on such a theory, these islands would all be completely hidden behind thousands of feet of curved Earth. In fact, the record-breaking longest distance zoom photograph ever taken recently showed Pic Gaspard from Pic de Finestrelles a whopping 275 miles away, at a height of under 10,000 feet, where, based on correct curvature calculations, the entire mountain should be invisible behind several miles of curved Earth. It is an observable, testable, repeatable, scientific fact of reality, that Polaris, the North Pole star situated perfectly over the North Pole center of Earth, never moves a single inch, night after night, year after year, century after century, with all the other fixed stars remaining fixed in their relative constellations revolving perfect circles around Polaris. It is an unobservable, unproven, unscientific theory to claim that thousands of years ago Polaris mysteriously did move and Thuban or other stars became the center of rotation. It is also an unobservable, unscientific theory to claim that the Earth is spinning a thousand miles per hour around an axis, while rotating tens of thousands of miles per hour around the Sun, while the entire solar system circles hundreds of thousands of miles per hour around the Milky Way, and the Milky Way shoots millions of miles per hour more off through infinite space, when we cannot see, hear, feel, or otherwise observe or prove any such motion, and we can see clearly for ourselves Polaris never moving and all the other stars revolving around it. Not only that, but such circular star trails around an unmoving Pole Star prove that it is the stars themselves moving, and not the Earth. If the Earth were truly a tilting, wobbling, spinning space-ball undergoing these multiple contradictory motions through the universe, you would only see irregular spiral-shaped star-trails and the night sky would never be the same twice. It would be impossible for constellations to exist whatsoever if Earth were truly undergoing these various theoretical motions. This is just a brief introduction to the many observable, testable, repeatable, scientific facts of our level motionless plane Earth that have been marginalized, suppressed and ridiculed for centuries, in favor of various unobservable, untestable, unscientific theories purporting we live on a tilting, wobbling, spinning, ball-shaped Earth.

Please share this video with the atheists you know and help spread the truth about our flat, motionless Earth  ("
25,The History of Flat Earth,"From the beginning of recorded history, and for thousands upon thousands of years, cultures across the entire world all believed the Earth was flat.  Their various cosmologies and cosmogonies differed in slight ways but their overall geographies and astronomies were incredibly consistent and in fact virtually identical.  The Earth was a stationary plane void of any motion or curvature, flat across its entire expanse except of course for hills, mountains and valleys.  The North Pole was the magnetic  mono-pole center-point of the flat Earth with Polaris, the North Pole star situated directly above.  Polaris was the only motionless star in the heavens with all the other constellations revolving perfect circles over the Earth every night.  The stars were divided into two categories known as the fixed stars and the wandering stars.  The fixed stars were so-called because they were observed then as we can observe today to stay fixed in their constellation patterns night after night, year after year, century after century, never changing their relative positions.  The wandering stars, what are today referred to as ""planets,"" were so-called because they were observed then as we can observe today to wander the heavens taking their own unique spirograph-like patterns making both forward and retrograde motions over and around the Earth during their cycles. The Sun and Moon were both of equal size and they too revolved over and 
around the motionless Earth as immortalized in the Chinese Yin Yang 
symbol.  The Sun and Moon were much closer to Earth than supposed nowadays and each shined with their own unique opposite lights, the Sun's being warm, golden, drying, preservative and antiseptic, and the Moon's light being cold, silver, damp, putrefying and septic.  The Sun and Moon as though connected to a magnetic maypole made alternating spiral journeys over and around the Earth every year.  The Sun began its journey at the Tropic of Capricorn at the Winter Solstice where it made its fastest and largest circle over the Earth.  For the next three months every day the Sun slightly narrowed its path and slowed its speed until by the Spring Equinox the Sun had spiraled its way from the Tropic of Capricorn to the equator.  Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continued to slightly narrow its path and slow its speed until the Summer Solstice when the Sun made its smallest, slowest circle around the Tropic of Cancer.  Once the Sun reached this innermost circle, like the ribbons and dancers around the maypole, the Sun would then begin its opposing, widening, quickening journey back to the Tropic of Capricorn.  For the next three months every day the Sun slightly widened its path and hastened its speed until the Autumnal Equinox the Sun had spiraled its way from the Tropic of Cancer back to the equator.  Then for the next three months again every day the Sun continued to slightly widen its path and hasten its speed until the Winter Solstice when the Sun made its largest, fastest circle around the Tropic of Capricorn and the annual journey began again. The Moon had a similar yearly path revolving over and around the Earth but unlike the Sun, which constantly changed its speed to keep a consistent 24 hour day, the Moon's speed never changed so depending on its latitude the Moon was observed then as we can observe today to take approximately 24.7 - 25 hours per cycle.  This is why at different times and places during each month we can see the Moon in the morning, afternoon or night.  This is also the origin of old fairy tales such as the the Hare and the Hedgehog or the Tortoise and the Hare.  The Hare, like the Sun, begins the annual race full of energy, excitement and ego, declaring himself the definite winner and gets off to an immediate head-start.  Meanwhile, equally confident in his seemingly lesser abilities, the humble, slow and steady Tortoise Moon begins as well allowing the Hare to lead.  As the race carries on, the cocky hare tires and slows down or takes a nap at which point the Tortoise overtakes him.  This is analogous to the Moon reaching the Tropic of Cancer before the Sun each year and beginning its return journey.  When the Hare reaches this half-way point of the race he realizes his lackluster attitude has resulted in being overtaken by the slower Tortoise and begins to speed up again.  Then for the remainder of the race, the Sun picks up speed day by day gaining on the Moon, but ultimately losing as the slow and steady Tortoise reaches the finish-line before the Hare and wins. So for ancient man, Earth and Polaris were the two immovable center-points of the Universe around which the Sun, Moon and other stars all revolved in a dome-like shape.  Some cultures believed in a literal, physical solid dome or firmament to which the fixed stars were bound.  Other cultures mythologized the axis mundi as the World Tree with Polaris at the center and all the other constellations forming the branches.  In these flat Earth depictions the North Pole occupied the centerpoint, and ""South"" was all straight lines extending outwards from there.  East and West were not straight-lines as is assumed nowadays, but were in fact circles just like all lines of latitude and the paths of the celestial bodies.  The southern circumference of Earth was surrounded by a gigantic wall of ice 150-200 feet above sea-level holding the interconnected oceans in like a world cup.  Beyond the ice wall, some cultures claimed a firm barrier existed through which no human could penetrate.  Other cultures believed there were entire worlds and other civilizations existing beyond the Antarctic ice. Currently, and for the past half century there has existed an International Antarctic Treaty preventing all independent exploration of Antarctica.  Pre-approved guided tours exist which take visitors to a few coastal regions of Antarctica, but no independent exploration of the continent is allowed.  Sailors like Jarle Andehoy have been caught attempting to explore Antarctica and threatened, turned around at gunpoint, fined, and jailed for violating this militarily enforced international treaty.  As a result the public currently has no way to confirm or deny the seemingly fantastical claims of ancient man concerning what may or may not exist at the southern-most extremities of the Earth. We can however confirm that this 200 foot ice-wall surrounding the southern circumference of the Earth most certainly exists.  We can confirm that Polaris is indeed the only non-moving star in the sky.  All the fixed stars indeed rotate perfect circles around Polaris while remaining stuck in their relative constellations night after night, year after year, century after century.  The wandering stars or ""planets"" do indeed wander the heavens taking their own unique spirograph-like paths when charted from a geocentric perspective.  The Sun and Moon are indeed observably of equal size and revolve over and around us in daily cycles.  Just as the ancients observed, the Sun's annual path does indeed travel from the Tropic of Capricorn at the Winter Solstice, to the Equator at Spring Equinox, to the Tropic of Cancer at the Summer Solstice, back to the Equator at Autumnal Equinox, and finally back to the Tropic of Cancer at Winter Solstice.  The Sun's light is indeed warm, golden, drying, preservative and antiseptic, while the Moon's light is indeed cold, silver, damp, putrefying and septic.  A thermometer placed in the Sun's light will always read warmer than a thermometer placed in the Sun's shade, while a thermometer placed in the Moon's light will always read cooler than a thermometer placed in the Moon-shade.  Plant and animal substances exposed to sunlight quickly dry, shrink, coagulate and lose their tendency to decompose and putrify, whereas plant and animal substances exposed to moonlight will quickly show symptoms of putrefaction and decay. Last but not least, just as the ancients espoused, the Earth is observably motionless to all our senses, and the horizon remains perfectly flat as far as the eye can see.  Not only does the horizon remain perfectly flat 360 degrees around the observer, but whether at sea-level, the top of Mount Everest, 35,000 feet high in an airplane, or even at over 100,000 feet high, the highest any amateur hot-air balloon has ever flown, the flat horizon actually rises to the eye-level of the observer all the way up.  On a globular Earth, no matter how large it is assumed to be, the horizon would remain where it was and the rising observer would have to tilt his head downwards further and further the higher they rose to see the steadily falling horizon.  Many people will be shocked to know that to this day, every single scientific experiment ever devised to show the alleged motion of the Earth has failed to do so (or given evidence of the opposite, that the Earth is indeed motionless) and every attempt ever made to measure the alleged curvature of the Earth has failed to do so (or given evidence of the opposite, that the Earth is indeed flat). The first person in recorded history to ever claim that Earth was anything but the flat, motionless center of the universe was a Greek mathematician and philosopher named Pythagoras of Samos around 500 B.C.  Interestingly enough, Pythagoras has also been touted by Freemasonic historians such as Albert Mackey, James Anderson, William Hutchinson and William Preston as being the very first Freemason!  Presented more as a thought-experiment than a complete cosmology, Pythagoras posited that if the Earth were a spherical globe turning on its vertical axis once per day while revolving annually around a stationary Sun, that this model could also equally explain the cyclical motions of the heavenly bodies.  This heliocentric model was taught to initiates at Pythagoras' Crotona school but never became popular or had an influence outside of Greece for another two thousand years. A century later, another Greek mathematician and philosopher named Plato also espoused a spherical Earth cosmology, except he claimed the Earth globe to be the motionless center of the universe with the Sun, Moon and stars revolving around.  His most famous student, Aristotle also wrote about this geocentric globe-Earth cosmology in his book ""On the Heavens,"" offering three main points of evidence for his theory.  Firstly Aristotle noted that when sailing away from an observer on shore, ships approaching the horizon disappeared from view hull before masthead and he postulated that this occurrence was due to the curvature of the Earth.  Aristotle argued that the hull disappeared first because beyond the horizon the globe-Earth curved downwards causing the hull and eventually the masthead and entire ship to drop below the curvature.  Today we can easily prove that Aristotle was incorrect in his assumption by using telescopes, binoculars and zoom cameras.  Once a ship has completely disappeared beyond the horizon, modern technology allows us to zoom in and bring the entire vessel, hull and all, back into full view.  This proves that ships do not disappear hull-first due to the alleged curvature of the Earth, and that the horizon line is in fact merely the vanishing point of perspective from a given observer's point of view, and not as Aristotle supposed, the beginning of the Earth's curvature.  The horizon is subjective and varies in distance depending on the weather, the observer's height, and the strength of his eyesight or instruments.  As noted previously, the horizon actually rises to the eye of the observer no matter how high he climbs, which also proves that the horizon line is not some objective point of curvature on a convex Earth, but rather the subjective vanishing point of perspective from a given observer's point of view. Aristotle's second point of evidence offered for his spherical Earth theory was the Earth's round shadow cast on the Moon during lunar eclipses.  To this day heliocentrists still offer this argument as proof of a spherical Earth, claiming that during lunar eclipses the Sun, Earth and Moon align in a perfect 180 degree syzygy like three billiard balls causing the Sun to cast the Earth's shadow onto the Moon.  This clever but faulty assumption is rendered completely invalid, however, due to the fact that lunar eclipses have happened and continue to happen regularly when both the Sun and Moon are still visible together above the horizon!  As early as the time of Pliny the Elder there are records of eclipses happening while both the Sun and Moon were visible in the sky, and continue to be recorded by the Royal Astronomical Society today.  Obviously if the Sun and Moon are both observable simultaneously during an eclipse then they are not aligned in a 180 degree syzygy and it is therefore impossible that the Sun could be casting Earth's shadow on the Moon, and some other explanation must be sought.  Another explanation, in fact, already existed in many cultures around the world, who posited that a third celestial body known as Rahu, or ""The Black Sun"" also existed equal in size to the Sun and Moon.  This translucent dark body passed affront of the Sun and Moon during solar and lunar eclipses causing their lights to dim. Aristotle's final point of evidence offered for his spherical Earth theory was the appearance of Polaris and other stars to gradually decline overhead as an observer travels southwards.  He argued that the gradual declination and eventual disappearance beyond the horizon of certain stars and constellations as one traveled southwards was evidence that the observer was traveling over a convex curved surface.  Similar to the ships disappearing over the horizon argument, Aristotle posited that the horizon line was the literal curvature of his spherical Earth, and the stars which declined and disappeared beyond it became invisible because a mass of curved Earth existed between them and the observer.  In actual fact, however, the gradual declination of objects in the sky towards the horizon is merely a product of the law of perspective on plane surfaces.  As any art student of point perspective knows, the human eye views the world in a pyramidal shape so that when looking down a long hallway, the floor appears to rise, the ceiling appears to sink, and the walls appear to narrow into a point at the center of the observer's view.  Of course, the dimensions of the hallway remain constant for its entire length; The floor does not actually rise, the ceiling does not actually sink, nor do the walls actually close in; but to the human eye everything is perceived this way.  Similarly when the Sun, Moon, airplanes or clouds appear to sink towards the horizon as they move away from us, they are not actually losing altitude and slowly approaching sea-level.  They are in fact maintaining the same altitude except they are moving away from you and so the law of perspective makes them appear to sink. A century after Aristotle, around 250 B.C. yet another Greek mathematician and philosopher named Eratosthenes made his claim to fame with a new alleged proof of the spherical Earth.  Eratosthenes noted that at noon during the Summer Solstice in Syene, the Sun cast no shadow and the rays could reach straight to the bottom of his well, yet meanwhile in Alexandria a vertically standing metal rod cast a significant shadow.  By factoring the length of the shadow with his assumed distance to the Sun, Eratosthenes recorded a measurement of Earth's circumference close to what heliocentrist astronomers still use today.  The fact of the matter is, however, that Eratosthenes' calculations were made assuming the Sun to be millions of miles away so that its rays would fall perfectly parallel even in points as divergent as Syene and Alexandria.  This faulty premise led to his faulty conclusion, which was eventually exposed upon the invention of the nautical sextant.  Using sextants and plane trigonometry, by measuring the Sun's angle at two points on Earth simultaneously and factoring their distance from each other, the Pythagorean theorum reveals both the height and dimensions of the Sun.  Using this method, the Sun and Moon have repeatedly been calculated to be approximately 32 miles in diameter, 3000 miles from the surface of the Earth.  High altitude balloon footage has also filmed lighting hot-spots on clouds proving the Sun to be local and acting as a spotlight, and not a burning ball of gas millions of miles away as supposed by heliocentrists.  After Eratosthenes, the globe-Earth theory completely disappeared from philosophical thought and recorded history for almost two millennia.  Geocentric flat-Earth cosmologies continued to reign supreme, with even Eratosthenes himself, touted as the ""Father of Geography,"" depicting the Earth as flat in his famous 194 B.C. map of the world.  Crates of Mallus invented the first model globe-Earth around this time as well, but it failed to have any effect on the world at large. Fast-forward to 1522 A.D. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan became the first person in known history to successfully sail around the world.  This circumnavigation of Earth soon became and continues to be touted today as absolute proof of the spherical Earth theory.  If Magellan was able to sail East-West around the entire world and return to his original starting point, surely the Earth cannot be flat and must be a globe, right?  Wrong.  Just as a compass can place its center-point on a flat piece of paper, trace a circle either way around, and return to its starting point, so can a ship or plane circumnavigate a flat Earth.  The only kind of circumnavigation which could not happen on a flat Earth is North-South-bound which to this day has still never been done.  Both the North Pole and Antarctica are military-enforced no-fly/no-sail zones due to restrictions originating from none other than the United Nations - the same United Nations that haughtily uses a flat Earth map in their official logo and flag. In 1543, just days before his death, Freemason and Jesuit Nicolaus Copernicus published his book ""On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres"" which revived the old heliocentric cosmology of Pythagoras and began the so-called Copernican Revolution away from a flat geocentric model and towards a global heliocentric model.  Since his book claimed Earth to be a tilting, wobbling, spinning sphere revolving at break-neck speeds around a stationary Sun, it was initially met with due incredulity.  Copernicus always countered this by claiming his theories were merely hypotheses and shouldn't be considered truth.  In his book he even wrote, ""The Pythagorean teaching was founded upon hypothesis and it is not necessary that the hypothesis should be true, or even probable.  The hypothesis of the movement of the Earth is only one which is useful to explain phenomena, but it should not be considered as an absolute truth."" Contemporaries of Copernicus such as Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe famously argued against his heliocentric model, positing that if the Earth revolved in an orbit round the Sun, the change in relative position of the stars after 6 months of orbital motion could not fail to be seen.  Brahe wrote that the stars should seem to separate as we approach and come together as we recede.  In actual fact, however, after millions of miles of supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax could be detected in the stars.  As even Wikipedia notes, ""The lack of any observable parallax was considered a fatal flaw in any non-Geocentric theory."" Copernicus' answer to this obvious problem was simple.  He moved the stars so ridiculously far away from the Earth that even after millions of miles of supposed orbit around the Sun, no appreciable parallax could be detected.  Copernicus simply needed to claim that the stars were trillions upon trillions of miles away, so then mathematically-speaking it would indeed be impossible to detect such slight parallax.  Again, contemporaries of Copernicus argued against this convenient correction of his, arguing quite rightly that if the stars were trillions of miles away, then there is no way we could see them!  Back-peddling once again, Copernicus claimed the reason we could still see stars trillions of miles away, was because they were not mere tiny points of translucent light in the night sky, but that stars were in fact gigantic gas balls billions of times larger than our Sun.  So first Copernicus had to move the stars trillions of miles from Earth to explain away lack of parallax, and then he had to make the stars billions of times larger to account for why we should see them at all from such fantastical distances.  Lastly he offered very specific distances and mathematical equations to solidify his theory, claiming, for instance, that he had accurately calculated the Sun's distance from Earth to be exactly 3,391,200 miles. At the turn of the 17th century, Tycho Brahe under the patronage of Emperor Rudolph II began construction of the largest, most state-of-the-art astronomical observatory ever built.  Upon hearing this, German astronomer and Freemason Johannes Kepler was determined to apprentice under Brahe.  Even though Kepler championed Copernicus's widely disputed heliocentric globe-Earth theory, Brahe begrudgingly accepted Kepler as his apprentice based on his merit as an astute astronomer and mathematician.  Brahe allowed Kepler access to the observatory, but guarded his data and findings from him completely, which frustrated and angered Kepler to the point of eventually culminating in a heated argument between the two of them resulting in Brahe kicking Kepler out.  After much amends and apologizing, a year later Brahe finally forgave Kepler and accepted him back as apprentice.  This time, however, Kepler was not content with his role as mere apprentice and soon proposed and secured a commissioned position on Brahe and Emperor Rudolph's new project, ""the Rudolphine Astronomical Tables.""  Less than a month later, Tycho Brahe mysteriously dropped dead, and Johannes Kepler was given access to all of Brahe's coveted data, free-reign of the observatory, and become Emperor Rudolph's new official astronomer.  Abundant circumstantial evidence and obvious motive have long fed speculation that Kepler actually murdered Brahe.  Brahe was only 54 years old and in fine health when suddenly he became deathly ill and passed away.  His official cause of death was reported as a bladder infection, but subsequent autopsies of his body revealed toxic quantities of mercury present on his moustache hairs which has led many researchers to conclude he was poisoned.  The 2004 book ""Heavenly Intrigue"" suggested that Kepler had indeed murdered Brahe to gain access to his data.  Kepler himself never denied this and he actually wrote, ""I confess that when Tycho died, I quickly took advantage of the absence, or lack of circumspection, of the heirs, by taking the observations under my care, or perhaps usurping them.""  And so for the remainder of his life Kepler worked at Brahe's observatory for Brahe's employer using Brahe's data to further his Copernican theories which Brahe had always criticized.  He modified Copernicus's calculations of celestial motions changing them from perfect circles to irregular ellipses, and even formulated a new updated distance of the Sun from Earth.  While Copernicus had claimed positively the Sun to be 3,391,200 miles from Earth, Kepler assured the astronomical community that his new figure of 12,376,800 miles was the true distance. A few years later, in 1608 the first telescope was invented, and by 1609 the next champion of Copernicism, Italian astronomer, Freemason and probable Jesuit Galileo Galilei, had purchased and built several of them.  Galileo improved upon the telescope's design boosting the zoom capabilities from the original 3x up to 30x magnification and in 1610 made the most important alleged discovery of his career.  With his 30x zoom telescope, Galileo claimed to have seen what he described as ""three fixed stars, totally invisible by their smallness, all close to Jupiter, and lying on a straight line through it.""  After tracking these ""invisible stars"" for a while and noticing they appeared sometimes but not others, Galileo concluded that when he could not find them they must be hiding behind Jupiter and therefore they must not be ""invisible stars"" at all, but rather ""invisible moons"" orbiting Jupiter.  His alleged discovery of moons orbiting Jupiter was then touted as proof of the Copernican system, claiming that Earth must be a planet like Jupiter since both have orbiting moons.  To this day, NASA claims to have special telescopes which can (on occasion) see these moons of Jupiter, just as Galileo claimed in his day to see (on occasion) with his special telescopes.  Nowadays with modern telescopes and zoom technology, we can see the celestial bodies far closer and with far more clarity than Galileo could have ever hoped for.  A 2016 Nikon P900 has 83x optical zoom and 332x digital, capabilities which put Galilean telescopes to shame, yet even with this level of magnification Galileo's alleged ""invisible stars"" orbiting Jupiter are nowhere to be found. Galileo and his fellow-Mason predecessors, acting more like true-believers of their heliocentric faith than legitimate scientists, were constantly guilty of inventing elaborate theories to support their foregone conclusion.  This was never more evident than when Galileo presented his theory on the cause of tides in 1616.  Cardinal Bellarmine had written Galileo the year before stating that ""the Copernican system could not be defended without a true physical demonstration that the Sun does not circle the Earth but the Earth circles the Sun.""  Taking this to heart, Galileo hoped to show that the Earth's tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water as a point on Earth's surface sped up and slowed down due to Earth's alleged rotation on axis and revolution around the Sun.  He argued that these hypothetical motions of his globular Earth were the cause of tides, and therefore the tides were proof of Earth's motion.  Unfortunately for Galileo, his ideas were not accepted and easily proven wrong by his contemporaries who rightly pointed out that if his theory were correct, there would only be one high tide per day.  Not only this, but if tides were caused by Earth's alleged motion, all lakes, ponds and other inland bodies of water should be similarly affected, yet they are not. The next champion of heliocentricism was English mathematician and astronomer, knighted Freemason and Royal Society President ""Sir"" Isaac Newton.  In 1687 Newton published his famous Principia Mathematica, which presented his idea of ""gravity"" to the world.  The globe-Earth theory had long faced criticism for being impractical due to the natural physics of spinning spherical objects.  Namely, that anything placed on their surface should immediately fall or fly off!  How could people, buildings, and the great oceans remain perfectly stuck to a ball-Earth spinning faster than the speed of sound?  The globe-Earth theory needed a force that could keep everything in place somehow; a force strong enough to keep the oceans stuck to the Earth, but weak enough not to sink a sailboat; a force strong enough to drag the entire atmosphere along with Earth's break-neck speed, but weak enough to allow birds and bugs to travel freely and unabated in all directions; a force so strong it could make rain fall upwards and plants grow upside down, but yet so weak that it could not be detected by any contemporary methods.  Newton's postulate of ""an invisible force able to act over vast distances"" led to him being heavily criticized for ""introducing occult agencies into the field of science."" Previous to Newton's theory of universal gravitation, the natural laws of density and buoyancy already perfectly and adequately explained the world around us.  For example, the reason a balloon filled with helium rises into the sky while a balloon filled with air drops to the ground, is not because Newton's mystical pulling force has an aversion to helium, but rather simply because helium is lighter and less dense than the nitrogen, oxygen and other elements which compose the air around it, so it floats up, and conversely, a balloon filled with your carbon dioxide exhalation is heaver and denser than the air around it, so it falls down to the ground.  If you blow a dandelion seed out of your hands, a substance just barely heavier than the air, it will float away and slowly but eventually fall to the ground.  If you drop an anvil from your hands, something much heavier than the air, it will quickly and directly fall straight to the ground.  This is not because gravity prefers anvils to dandelion seeds, but rather because it is the natural physics of buoyancy for objects less dense than the medium surrounding them to rise, while objects denser than the medium surrounding them sink.  This is the reason raindrops fall down through the air and air-bubbles rise up through the water - because of their relative densities.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the mystical pulling force of spinning balls from Newton's imagination. Newton's theory allegedly began when upon seeing an apple fall from a tree at Woolsthorpe, as though no one in the history of humanity up to that point had ever seen a falling object and wondered why it fell, he had a veritable scientific epiphany.  The apple fell not because it was heavier and denser than the air around it, but rather because a force at the center of the spinning ball-Earth pulled it to the ground!  Newton quickly got to work formulating his theory of universal gravitation which he used to explain not only falling objects, but also orbiting celestial bodies.  Newton claimed that the Sun, Moon, Earth, planets and stars' gravity caused them to all orbit around the most massive nearby bodies.  So not only was gravity fickle and selective about which objects it caused to fall and which it allowed to rise, gravity was also able to perform different functions on different scales.  At the human scale, gravity allegedly caused people, buildings and oceans to stick to the Earth, while at the planetary scale, gravity allegedly caused moons to orbit around planets and planets to orbit around stars.  Unfortunately Newton never addressed this, but the question remains, how and why would gravity cause both planets to orbit the Sun and people to stick to the Earth?  Gravity should either cause people to float around in suspended circular orbits around the Earth, or it should cause the Earth, Moon and planets to all be pulled and crash into the Sun.  The two effects are very different yet the same cause is attributed to both. Furthermore, this magnetic-like attraction of massive objects gravity is purported to have can be found nowhere in the natural world.  There is no example in nature of a massive sphere or any other shaped-object which by virtue of its mass alone causes smaller objects to stick to or orbit around it!  There is nothing on Earth massive enough that it can be shown to cause even a dust-bunny to stick to or orbit around it.  Try spinning a wet tennis ball or any other spherical object with smaller things placed on its surface and you will find that everything falls or flies off, and nothing sticks to or orbits it.  To claim the existence of a physical ""law"" without a single practical evidential example is hearsay, not science.  By now, however, you are likely beginning to see that these Freemasonic heliocentric priests are less interested in science and truth than they are in propagating contrived evidences for their foregone conclusions.  In like manner, as Copernicus had claimed positively the Sun to be 3,391,200 away and Kepler had calculated it to be 12,376,800 miles away, Newton was quoted as remarking, ""It matters not whether we reckon it 28 or 54 million miles distant for 
either would do just as well!""  It appears he was correct, because the 
alleged distance to the heliocentrist's Sun has continued to increase 
by the millions until today where we stand with NASA's current official 
figure of 93 million. In 1773 Captain Cook became the first modern explorer known to have breached the Antarctic circle and reached the ice barrier.  This expedition offered an exciting chance to find proof of either the flat or globe Earth models because Captain Cook intended to sail completely around Antarctica looking for inlets through the ice-wall.  If the Earth was indeed a globe 25,000 miles in equatorial circumference as the heliocentrists claimed, then a complete circumnavigation of Antarctica would be approximately 12,000 miles, and if the Earth was flat with Antarctica surrounding the entire circumference, a complete circumnavigation of Antarctica would have to take over 50,000 miles.  During three voyages lasting three years and eight days, Captain Cook and crew sailed a total of 60,000 miles along the Antarctic coastline never once finding an inlet or path through or beyond the massive glacial wall!  Captain Cook wrote: ""The ice extended east and west far beyond the reach of our sight, while the southern half of the horizon was illuminated by rays of light which were reflected from the ice to a considerable height."" Later voyages by Captain James Clark Ross and Captain George Nares in the 19th century further confirmed Cook's findings.  Ross's expedition spent 4 years and 5 months in heavily armored warships failing to find an entry point beyond the southern glacial wall, and Nares spent over 3 years circumnavigating Antarctica, taking an admittedly indirect course, but clocking in nearly 69,000 miles total!  If Antarctica truly was the tiny ice-continent claimed by globe-Earth proponents, all of these expeditions would have ended years sooner.  In addition to this, many Antarctic explorers including Captain James Clark Ross and Lieutenant Charles Wilkes using globe-Earth projection maps, wrote in their journals perplexed at how they routinely found themselves out of accordance with their charts, stating that they found themselves an average of 12-16 miles outside their reckoning every day, later on further south increasing to as much as 29 miles per day!  These huge discrepancies experienced by explorers the further south traveled are usually attributed to increasingly strong storms, winds and currents, but if that were the case they should have just as often found themselves ahead of their reckoning, which they never did. In 1783 the hot air balloon was invented and for the first time in recorded history people were able to float miles above the Earth's surface and see for themselves once and for all whether or not the Earth was flat or a globe.  To many people's astonishment, as high as they rose, the horizon remained perfectly flat 360 degrees around them and rose to the level of their eyes all the way up.  J. Glaisher wrote in his ""Travels in the Air,"" that, ""on looking over the top of the car, the horizon appeared to be on a level with the eye, and taking a grand view of the whole visible area beneath, I was struck with its great regularity; all was dwarfed to one plane; it seemed too flat.""  M. Victor Emanuel, another hot-air balloonist wrote that, ""Instead of the Earth declining from the view on either side, and the higher part being under the car, as is popularly supposed, it was the exact opposite; the lowest part, like a huge basin, being immediately under the car and the horizon on all sides rising to the level of the eye.""  As stated previously, this is only possible on a flat plane. It would be an entire century after Newton published his theories on gravitation before any scientific experiment was devised to attempt to prove its existence.  In 1797, Henry Cavendish, the British scientist, Freemason, and wealthy grandson of the Duke of Devonshire, created an experiment which he claimed successfully proved the existence of gravity, measured its constant, and provided accurate figures for the exact masses of the Earth, Sun, Moon, and Planets.  How did Cavendish achieve this quantum leap for heliocentric pseudo-science?  He fixed two large lead balls on opposite ends of a torsion balance and hung them from the roof of his shed.  By watching and recording slight motions of the contraption via telescope through his shed window so his mass would not affect the reading, Cavendish claimed to have proven gravity.  Two small lead balls were hung near the large ones and any motion observed towards one another was touted as being the influence of gravity. Now, the Cavendish experiment has been widely criticized by the scientific community because never in over two centuries since its creation has anyone been able to replicate it!  Firstly, the balls simply do not always attract one another as they must for the so-called gravitational constant to be constant at all.  Sometimes the torsion balance turns towards the balls and sometimes away as it is impossible not to give some slight tremulous motion when interacting with it.  Henry even complained in his notes how often as he was performing the measurement the contraption was still in oscillation.  Secondly, since his calculated force of gravity was 10^39 weaker than the force of electro-magnetism, from which all material objects are composed, there is no control for the experiment which can factor out and positively differentiate the alleged gravitational force, from the known stronger electro-magnetic force.  In other words, the balls could simply be attracting each other through static electricity, a known force existing in all things, billions of times stronger than gravity, and impossible to control for the experiment.  Even though no one could replicate Cavendish's findings, the experiment went down in history as a great success, and is still taught as veritable proof of universal gravitation in science textbooks today. Half a century later, in 1851, a French scientist named Leon Foucault performed a similar experiment to Cavendish, but this time hanging a single ball from the ceiling, swinging it, and claiming all lateral motion observed to be proof that the Earth was turning beneath the pendulum!  Since Foucault's original demonstration, these pendulums have regularly been swinging at museums and exhibition halls worldwide purporting to provide everlasting perpetual proof of the heliocentric spinning ball-Earth theory.  The truth is, however, unbeknownst to most of the duped public, that Foucault's pendulum is a failed experiment which proves nothing but how easy it is for pseudo-science to deceive the malleable masses.  To begin with, Foucault's pendulums do not uniformly swing in any one direction.  Sometimes they rotate clockwise and sometimes counter-clockwise, sometimes they fail to rotate and sometimes they rotate far too much.  Just like the Cavendish experiment, scientists who have attempted to replicate Foucault's findings have conceded time and again that ""it was difficult to avoid giving the pendulum some slight lateral bias at starting.""  In truth, the behavior of the pendulum actually depends on 1) the initial force beginning its swing and, 2) the ball-and-socket joint used which most readily facilitates circular motion over any other.  The supposed rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the pendulum's swing.  If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion.  If the Earth's diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth! Also in the mid-19th century, another Frenchman named Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis performed several experiments showing the effect of kinetic energy on rotating systems, which have ever since become mythologized as proof of the heliocentric theory.  His ""Coriolis Effect"" is often said to cause sinks and toilet bowls in the Northern Hemisphere to drain spinning in one direction while in the Southern Hemisphere causing them to spin the opposite way, thus providing proof of the spinning ball-Earth.  Once again, however, just like Foucault's swinging pendulums and Cavendish's hanging balls, sinks and toilets in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres do not consistently spin in any one direction!  Sinks and toilets in the very same household are often found to spin opposite directions, depending entirely upon the shape of the basin and the angle of the water's entry, not the supposed rotation of the Earth.  The Coriolis Effect is also said to affect bullet trajectories and weather patterns as well, supposedly causing most storms in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate counter-clockwise, and most storms in the Southern Hemisphere to rotate clockwise, to cause bullets from long range guns to tend towards the right of the target in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.  Again, however, the same problems remain.  Not every bullet and not every storm consistently displays the behavior and therefore cannot reasonably be used as proof of anything. In the late 19th century, mostly thanks to the experiments, books, and lectures of an English inventor and author named Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, a flat Earth renaissance began sweeping the world.  Rowbotham's findings, beginning with his 1864 book, ""Earth Not a Globe! An Experimental Inquiry into the True Figure of the Earth: Proving it a Plane, Without Axial or Orbital Motion; and the Only Material World in the Universe,"" caused quite a stir in the scientific community and thanks to three decades of his efforts, the shape of the Earth became a hot topic of debate around the turn of the 19th century.  Dr. Rowbotham conducted several experiments using telescopes, spirit levels, and theodolites, special precision instruments used for measuring angles in horizontal or vertical planes.  By positioning them at equal heights aimed at each other successively he proved over and over the Earth to be perfectly flat for miles without a single inch of curvature. In his most famous series of experiments, Rowbotham traveled to Cambridge, England where there is a 20 mile canal called the Old Bedford which passes in a straight line through the Fenlands known as the Bedford Level.  The water has no interruption from locks or water-gates of any kind and remains stationary making it perfectly suitable for determining whether any amount of convexity/curvature actually exists.  If we were living on a ball-Earth, every pond, lake, marsh, canal and other large body of standing water, each part would have to comprise a slight arc or semi-circle curving downwards from the central summit.  If the ball-Earth were truly 25,000 miles in circumference as claimed by heliocentrists, then spherical trigonometry dictates the surface of all standing water must curve downwards an easily measurable 8 inches per mile multiplied by the square of the distance.  This means along a 6 mile channel of standing water the Earth would have to curve 16 feet, 8 inches downwards from one end to the other, and/or dip 6 feet on either end from the central peak, depending where the measurement is taken. Rowbotham tested first by standing in the water holding a telescope 8 inches above the surface, while his partner rowed away from him in a small boat with a 5 foot tall flag attached.  If the Earth was indeed a globe 25,000 miles in circumference, by the time the boat reached Welney Bridge 6 miles away, the entire boat and flag should have been completely invisible hidden behind a 6 foot tall mass of curved water.  In reality however, every time tested, the entire boat and flag remained visible from start to finish.  In a second experiment Dr. Rowbotham placed seven flags along the edge of the water each one mile distant from the next with their tops positioned 5 feet above the surface and stood with his telescope behind the first.  If the Earth was a globe 25,000 miles in circumference, each successive flag would have to decline a definite and determined amount below the last.  The first and second flags establish the line of sight, then the third should fall 8 inches below the second, the fourth flag 32 inches below, the fifth 6 feet, the sixth 10 feet 8 inches, and the seventh flag should be a clear 16 feet 8 inches below the line of sight!  Even if the Earth was a globe of a hundred thousand miles, an amount of easily measurable curvature should and would still be evident in this experiment.  But the reality is not a single inch of curvature was detected and the flags all lined up perfectly as consistent with a flat plane. In 1870 one of Rowbotham's supporters, an English scientist of the Royal Academy named John Hampden, offered a public wager of 500 pounds to anyone who thought they could prove the Earth spherical by repeating the Bedford Level experiment.  Alfred Russell Wallace, a fellow English scientist, ardent evolutionist and personal friend of Charles Darwin, accepted Hampden's wager and the two met with referees to decide the matter at the Bedford Level.  The original plan was to repeat Rowbotham's flag experiment, but after hours of attempting to align them one on each mile marker, upon looking through the telescope ""they could not even judge which was which, let alone decide whether the line of sight along them was flat or curved.  Heated debate ensued, an angry quarrel followed, and the experiment descended into a farce.""  They called it a day, but a week later reconvened, this time Wallace setting new perimeters for the experiment which had never been tested or approved by Rowbotham or Hampden. Wallace hung a large calico sheet from the Old Bedford Bridge with a thick black line painted across its center and positioned his telescope six miles south at Welney Bridge at the same elevation.  Then halfway between these two points, Wallace placed a long red pole topped with a marker disc designed to fall in line with the black painted marker and telescope.  All of these he placed at a Masonically significant 13 feet 3 inches above the water.  Wallace's plan was to view the marker disc and black line through the telescope, and if the middle marker appeared below the line of sight, this would be taken as proof of the water's flat surface, and if the middle marker appeared above the line of sight it would be taken as proof of Earth's curvature.  Hampden immediately took issue with this new method of allegedly determining curvature but begrudgingly accepted to continue.  When viewed through the telescope, the center marker fell a tiny bit below the telescope cross-hair, and the far marker on the bridge fell a tiny bit below that.  This result was not expected by either party, but Wallace quickly claimed it proof that Earth was curving downwards, while Hampden claimed the results to be in accordance with the law of perspective over flat surfaces.  This time an even more heated debate ensued until Wallace refused to speak another word with Hampden, gave him the silent-treatment, and even had the police escort Hampden him from his hotel room before leaving town the following day. The referees for the wager decided in favor of Wallace and the money was given to him.  In response, Hampden immediately published a 16-page pamphlet denouncing Wallace as a liar and cheat called, ""Is Water Level or Convex After All?  The Bedford Canal Swindle Detected and Exposed.""  Another fellow English author and flat-Earther, William Carpenter, also present during the experiment, wrote his equally scathing 30-page review of the swindle entitled, ""Water Not Convex, The Earth Not a Globe! Demonstrated by Alfred Russel Wallace on the 5th March 1870""  Hampden later took Wallace to trial and sued him for his 500 pounds.  The court formally decided in favor of Hampden that the bet was invalid and returned his money in full. Next Hampden immediately re-issued his challenge to Wallace, increasing the wager to 1000 pounds and inviting Dr. Rowbotham to attend.  This time the experiment would be conducted as Rowbotham had originally done, standing in the water with telescope held 8 inches above the water observing a boat with a 5 foot flag attached sailing 6 miles away from Welche's Dam to Welney Bridge.  When the day of the wager came, poor weather prevented them from completing the experiment so they postponed, met more bad weather, and postponed again.  On their third and final attempt before heading home with the weather still overcast they attempted the experiment.  Unfortunately shortly after reaching the half-way point the boat became indistinguishable beyond the haze and the bet was called off.  The boat and flag were visible, however, for the entire 3 miles.  In 2015 a group of flat-Earthers once again repeated Rowbotham's experiment at the Bedford Level with similar results.  They detected no curvature and saw the boat beyond the half-way marker, but became obscured by poor weather before reaching the full 6 miles. In 1871, after getting massive amounts of pressure from the public to address these claims from flat-Earth proponents, Royal Astronomical Society President George Airy devised an experiment which he hoped would once and for all prove Earth's axial motion and forever silence the rabble-rousing flat-Earthers.  By first filling a telescope with water to slow down the speed of light inside, then calculating the tilt necessary to get the starlight directly down the tube, Airy planned to measure the speed of the telescope (and thereby the speed of the Earth) by extrapolating the amount of tilt needed to keep the starlight coming in straight.  The experiment, however, would go down in history and forever be known as ""Airy's Failure"" because every time he repeated it, Airy found the starlight was already coming in the correct angle with no change necessary, proving that the stars move relative to a stationary Earth and not the other way around.  Airy had meant to prove the heliocentric theory, but instead devised an ever-lasting proof of the geocentric model. In 1887 American physicists Albert Michelson and Edward Morley performed an experiment to determine Earth's speed through space, or what was then called ""the aether.""  By passing light through two pathways, one in the direction of the Earth's alleged motion, and the other at right angles to it, the light traveling with the Earth should have taken longer to return than light traveling at right angles to it.  To the surprise of Michelson, Morley and the scientific establishment, however, no difference whatsoever was detected, even after repeating the experiment several times in different places.  To attempt to patch up this glaring problem, the heliocentric establishment created the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction which actually had the gall to claim that the light pathway going the same direction as the Earth became physically shorter during the experiment so that the time to return became equal to the other pathway!  The implications of Michelson and Morley's experiment were so detrimental to the spinning globe-Earth myth, that they were forced to concoct this ludicrous back-peddling explanation which even Arthur Miller denounced calling it ""a physics of desperation."" After Samuel Rowbotham's death, Lady Elizabeth Blount, an English author, flat-Earther, vocal vegetarian and anti-vivisectionist founded the Universal Zetetic Society which attracted thousands of members and published a journal called ""The Earth Not a Globe Review"" for several decades.  Many other prominent flat-Earthers of the time also continued doing their best to spread the word.   John Hampden continued publishing his own work and reprinted all of Samuel Rowbotham's material.  In 1885 William Carpenter published his famous ""100 Proofs Earth is Not a Globe.""  In 1892 Alexander Gleason released his New Standard Map of the World AS IT IS which remains to this day one of the most accurate flat Earth maps ever created.  He had hoped it would completely replace globes and Mercator maps the world over, but unfortunately his map's influence was short-lived.  The next year in 1893 Gleason published his flat-Earth tome entitled, ""Is the Bible From Heaven, Is the Earth a Globe, Does Modern Science and the Bible Agree?"" which gave many flat Earth proofs and also explained his wonderful map.   In 1899, the South African flat-Earth author Thomas Winship published 
his excellent work, ""Zetetic Cosmogeny: Evidence that the World is Not a
 Rotating Revolving Globe but a Stationary Plane Circle."" 1903 marked the beginning of airplane travel, which, had it been invented in Copernicus' era would have destroyed his spinning ball-Earth fantasy long before take-off.  When hot-air balloons were first invented people were told the reason they cannot simply float in the air and wait for the spinning ball-Earth to bring their destinations to them, was because gravity somehow stuck the entire atmosphere and everything in it in place, dragging it along at 1000mph so uniformly that we can't see it, feel it, hear it, or measure it in any way.  Once airplane technology evolved so that we could fly at comparable speeds to the Earth's supposed rotation, however, it became immediately apparent that the Earth and its atmosphere could not be constantly rotating 1000mph West to East. Simply put, if the Earth were constantly spinning Eastwards 1000mph then airplane flight durations going Eastwards vs. Westwards would be significantly different.  If the average commercial airliner travels 500mph, it follows that Westbound equatorial flights should reach their destination at approximately three times the speed as their Eastbound return flights.  In reality, however, the differences in East/Westound flight durations usually amount to a matter of minutes, and nothing near what would occur on a 1000mph spinning ball Earth.  For example, flights Eastwards with the alleged spin of the ball-Earth from Tokyo to LA take an average of 10.5 hours, therefore the return flights Westwards against the alleged spin should take an average of 5.25 hours, but in actual fact take an average of 11.5 hours. Also of note, if Earth were a globe, there are several flights in the Southern Hemisphere which would have their quickest, straightest path over the Antarctic continent such as Santiago, Chile to Sydney, Australia.  Instead of taking the shortest, quickest route in a straight line over Antarctica, all such flights detour all manner of directions away from Antarctica instead claiming the temperatures too cold for airplane travel!  Considering the fact that there are plenty of flight to/from/over Antarctica, and NASA claims to have technology keeping them in conditions far colder (and far hotter) than any experienced on Earth, such as excuse is clearly just an excuse, and these flights aren't made because they are impossible. If Earth was a ball, and Antarctica was too cold to fly over, the only 
logical way to fly from Sydney to Santiago would be a straight shot over
 the Pacific staying in the Southern hemisphere the entire way.  
Re-fueling could be done in New Zealand or other Southern hemisphere 
destinations along the way if absolutely necessary.  In actual fact, 
however, Santiago-Sydney flights go into the Northern hemisphere making 
stop-overs at LAX and other North American airports before continuing 
back down to the Southern hemisphere.  Such ridiculously wayward detours
 make no sense on the globe but make perfect sense and form nearly 
straight lines when shown on a flat Earth map. On a ball-Earth, Johannesburg, South Africa to Perth, Australia should 
be a straight shot over the Indian Ocean with convenient re-fueling 
possibilities on Mauritus or Madagascar.  In actual practice, however, 
most Johannesburg to Perth flights curiously stop over either in Dubai, 
Hong Kong or Malaysia all of which make no sense on the ball, but are 
completely understandable when mapped on a flat Earth.  A casual study of other South Hemisphere flight paths and stop-over points will prove to even the most staunch skeptic the clear illegitimacy of globe map projections. Building on Michelson and Morley's experiment, in 1913 French physicist 
Georges Sagnac again proved the existence of the aether and the 
stillness of Earth by using a beam-splitter to send light in opposite 
directions around a path, recombining them, then observing their 
interference fringes, first while stationary and then while rotating the
 entire experiment table 2 revolutions per second.  The changes in 
interference patterns between the moving and non-moving trials proved 
that the light, and therefore the Earth, was stationary.  In 1914 William Westfield wrote his geocentric classic ""Does the Earth Rotate?  No!""  And when Gerard Hickson's masterpiece ""Kings Dethroned: A History of the Evolution of Astronomy from the Time of the Roman Empire up to the Present Day"" was published in 1922, the heliocentric theory of the universe was on its last legs.  In 1925 the Michelson-Gale experiment again vouched for a stationary Earth, and it was clear to the establishment that they needed something big to bring public opinion back their way. In 1916 a Jewish physicist named Albert Einstein had published his general theory of relativity, a brilliant revision of heliocentricism which in one philosophical swoop abolished the aether from scientific study replacing it with a form of relativism which allowed for heliocentricism and geocentricism to hold equal merit.  If there was no absolute aetheric medium within which all things exist, then hypothetically one could postulate complete relativism with regard to the movement of two objects such as the Earth and Sun.  In one philosophical leap, with no scientific evidence to support it, Einstein and the heliocentric establishment were thus able to sweep Airy's Failure, Michelson, Morley, Sagnac and Gale all conveniently under the carpet and pretend they didn't exist, simply by claiming that all motion in the universe was relative.  By the late 1920s Einstein and his theories had been pushed so vehemently, the heliocentric theory began making a come-back, and Einstein was being touted as a genius and one of the greatest minds in history.  Far from it, even he himself admitted when asked, ""what is it like to be the smartest man alive?"" responded by saying, ""I don't know, you'll have to ask Nicola Tesla,"" a true genius who in no way supported Einstein's relativity or the heliocentric theory.  Einstein was even caught lying when he originally claimed to have never even heard of the Michelson-Morley experiment, but later admitted that he had indeed created special relativity with the intent of abolishing the aether and nullifying the Michelson-Morley result. By the 1930s an eccentric Christian flat-Earther named Wilbur Glenn Voliva was attracting wide-spread publicity around the world thanks to his American lecture tours and daily radio broadcasts from his personal station which could be heard all the way to Australia.  Voliva famously founded and built Zion City in Illinois, a town of 6,500 people all of whom were Christian flat-Earthers.  Zion City even had its own schools and churches which taught flat Earth cosmology.  In the spirit of Rowbotham and Hampden, throughout his life Voliva offered an open-ended wager of $5000 to anyone who thought they could disprove the flat Earth.  Until his death in 1942 there were no takers. After the second World War, Operation Paperclip brought hundreds of top German rocket scientists and physicists into the United States and beginning in the late fifties employed them in NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Meanwhile the Russian space program was also forming and a so-called ""Space Race"" between America and Russia ensued.  The “geostationary communications satellite” was first imagined in a 1945 proposal by 
Freemason science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and supposedly became 
science-fact just over a decade later.  In 1957 Russia allegedly launched the first satellite named ""Sputnik"" into low-Earth orbit, followed in 1958 by America's ""Explorer 1."" Nowadays there are supposedly upwards of 20,000 such satellites constantly orbiting the Earth.  They are allegedly floating around in the thermosphere where 
temperatures are claimed to be upwards of 4,530 degrees Fahrenheit.  The
 metals used in satellites, however, such as aluminum, gold and titanium
 have melting points of 1,221, 1,948, and 3,034 degrees respectively, 
all far lower than they could possibly handle.  People often even claim to see satellites with their naked eyes, but this is 
ridiculous considering they are smaller than a bus and allegedly 100+ 
miles away;  It is impossible to see anything so small that far away.  
Even using telescopes, no one claims to discern the shape of satellites 
but rather describes seeing passing moving lights, which could easily be
 any number of things from airplanes to drones to shooting stars or 
other unidentified flying objects.  The fact that they are ""geostationary"" means they would not appear to move through the sky anyway, but rather be perpetually stuck in the exact same place all day every day. So-called “satellite” phones have been found to have reception problems 
in countries like Kazakhstan with very few cell phone towers.  If the 
Earth were a ball with 20,000+ satellites surrounding, such blackouts 
should not regularly occur in any rural countryside and deep ocean areas.  Also “satellite” TV dishes (which existed for years before ""satellites"" were supposedly invented) are almost always positioned at a 45 
degree angle towards the nearest ground-based repeater tower.  If TV 
antennae were actually picking up signals from satellites 100+ miles in 
space, most TV dishes should be pointing more or less straight up to the
 sky.  The fact that “satellite” dishes are never pointing straight up 
and almost always positioned at a 45 degree angle proves they are 
picking up ground-based tower signals.  Before satellites, radio, television, and 
navigation systems like LORAN and DECCA were already well-established 
and worked fine using only ground-based technologies.  Nowadays huge 
fibre-optics cables connect the internet across oceans, gigantic cell 
towers triangulate GPS signals, and ionospheric propagation allows radio
 waves to be bounced all without the aid of the science-fiction 
best-seller known as “satellites.” Also in the late fifties,  a sign-maker from Dover, England named Samuel Shenton in the spirit of Rowbotham and Lady Blount's Zetetic Society, created IFERS, the International Flat Earth Research Society, and began giving lectures on television, in newspapers, to youth clubs and schools about our flat, motionless Earth.  Shenton discovered the writings of the late 19th century flat Earth authors mentioned previously and made it his mission to spread the Zetetic message as far and wide as he could.  With NASA's supposed satellite launches happening, people constantly questioned Shenton about satellites proving the globe-Earth, to which he would always reply, ""does sailing around the Isle of Wight prove it is spherical?""  When NASA claimed to have put the first man in space, Shenton said from the beginning that it was all photo and video trickery.  When John Glenn supposedly orbited the world in 1963 Shenton even sent him a free IFERS membership with a personal message saying, ""OK wise guy."" Shenton knew that John Glenn, two-time US senator and one of NASA's first astronauts, was a lying Freemason just like his heliocentric fore-fathers from Pythagoras to Copernicus, Kepler to Cavendish, along with most all of NASA's astronauts.  Buzz Aldrin Jr. is an admitted, ring-wearing, hand-sign flashing 33rd degree Mason from Montclair Lodge No. 144 in New Jersey.  Edgar Mitchell is an Order of Demolay Mason at Artesta Lodge No. 29 in New Mexico.  James Irwin was a Tejon Lodge No. 104 member in Colorado Springs.  Donn Eisele was a member of the Luther B. Turner Lodge No. 732 in Ohio.  Gordon Cooper was a Master Mason in Carbondale Lodge No. 82 in Colorado.  Virgil Grissom was a Master Mason from Mitchell Lodge No. 228 in Indiana.  Walter Schirra Jr. was a 33rd degree Mason at Canaveral Lodge No. 339 in Florida.  Thomas Stafford is a Mason at Western Star Lodge No. 138 in Oklahoma.  Paul Weitz is from Lawrence Lodge No. 708 in Pennsylvania.  C. Fred Kleinknecht, the head of NASA during the Apollo program, shortly thereafter actually became Sovereign Grand Commander of the Council of the 33rd Degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry of the Southern Jurisdiction!  NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong, Allen Sheppard, William Pogue, Vance Brand and Anthony England all had fathers who were Freemasons as well!  The amount of astronauts known to be Freemasons or from Freemasonic families is astonishing.  It is likely that more astronauts and people of key importance in NASA are affiliated with the brotherhood as well, but not so open about their membership.  For there to be this many Masons, members of the world's largest and oldest secret society, involved with the promotion and propagation of this globalist heliocentric doctrine from its outset to modern times should raise some serious suspicion! Before the first Apollo mission ever even cleared the launch pad, 
eleven NASA astronauts died in highly suspicious ""accidents.""  Gus 
Grissom, Roger Chaffee and Ed White were all cremated together in an 
Apollo capsule fire during a completely unnecessary and dangerous test 
where they were strapped down and locked into a 100% oxygen chamber 
which incinerated the three of them to death in seconds.  Seven other 
astronauts, Ted Freemen, Charles Basset, Elliot See, Russell Rogers, 
Clifton Williams, Michael Adams and Robert Lawrence died in six separate
 airplane crashes, and Ed Givens in a car crash!  Eight of these deaths 
were in 1967 alone.  So many astronauts coincidentally dying under such 
circumstances is highly unlikely, and lends credence to the idea that 
these were intentional hits by the Masons trying to find the right 
people to sell their hoax. One of the most outspoken of
 the fallen astronauts was Gus Grissom.  By 1967 Grissom had become 
increasingly irritated and vocally negative about NASA's chances of ever
 landing man on the Moon.  He stated the odds were ""pretty slim"" and 
famously hung a lemon on the Apollo capsule after it repeatedly failed 
safety testing procedures.  Grissom threatened to go public with his 
complaints about the LEM, and even told his wife Betty, ""If there ever 
is a serious accident in the space program, it's likely to be me.""  
Right after his murder, government agents raided Grissom's house before 
anyone had been informed about the fire or his death.  They removed all 
his personal papers and his diary, never to be returned. From 1969-1972 the Freemasons at NASA claimed to have landed six of their Apollo missions on the Moon.  With this ingenious deception, a bit of rocket technology, a bunch of lying Freemasons and photographs taken through a round window, with this one psyop, NASA managed to convince nearly everyone on Earth that they live on a spinning ball.  However, in the documentary, ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon,"" you can watch official leaked NASA footage showing Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, for almost an hour, using transparencies and camera-tricks to fake shots of a round Earth!  They communicate over audio with control in Houston about how to accurately stage the shot, and someone keeps prompting them on how to effectively manipulate the camera to achieve the desired effect.  First they blacked out all the windows except for a downward facing circular one, which they aimed the camera towards from several feet away.  This created the illusion of a ball-shaped Earth surrounded by the blackness of space, when in fact it was simply a round window in their dark cabin.  Neil Armstrong claimed at this point to be 130,000 miles from Earth, half-way to the Moon, but when camera-tricks were finished the viewer could see for themselves the astro-nots were not more than a couple dozen miles above the Earth's surface flying in a high-altitude plane.  These images showing a globular world soon became the Freemasons most valuable tool in altering public perception about the shape of the Earth. Since the original so-called ""Blue Marble"" image, NASA has provided the public with many more pictures and videos showing a globe Earth, touting veritable photographic proof that Pythagoras' 2500 year old theory was finally validated.  When seen with a skeptical eye, however, professional photo-analysts have dissected several NASA images of the ball-Earth and found undeniable proof of computer editing.  For example, images of the Earth allegedly taken from the Moon have proven to be copied and pasted in, as evidenced by rectangular cuts found in the black background around the ""Earth"" by adjusting brightness and contrast levels.  If they were truly on the Moon and Earth was truly a ball, there would be no need to fake such pictures. When NASA's images of the ball-Earth are compared with one another the coloration of the land/oceans and relative size of the continents are consistently so drastically different from one another as to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the pictures are all fake.  NASA has many alleged photographs of the ball-Earth which show several exact, copy and pasted, duplicate cloud patterns!  Cheeky graphics artists have even placed things like faces, dragons and the word ""SEX"" into cloud patterns over various ball-Earth pictures.  One recent Pluto picture clearly has a picture of Disney's ""Pluto"" the dog layered into the background. On a clear afternoon, during a waxing or waning Moon cycle, it is possible to see the blue sky right through the Moon.  For centuries, stars and planets have often been seen and recorded even by the Royal Astronomical Society to have been seen through the Moon!  If the Moon is translucent enough to see objects through it, it cannot be the solid, spherical planetoid claimed by NASA and modern astronomers.  Samuel Shenton, President of IFERS was quoted before the Apollo supposed ""Moon landings,"" stating that, ""Stars have been seen through the Moon.  The astronauts had better be ready to come right back because there isn't anything much to land on!"" Besides Shenton, many of the first people to unequivocally call out the NASA Moon landings as being a staged hoax were professional photographers.  When the official NASA photographs of ""the Moon"" are closely examined it is clear that many were taken inside a studio using repetitive backgrounds, artificial lighting, wires and cranes.  Award-winning British photographer David Persey, photo-analyst/historian Jack White, photographer/Nexus magazine publisher Marcus Allen, and many others all put their professional reputations on the line to expose NASA's so-called photographic ""evidence. None of the Apollo missions brought any extra studio lighting with them on the Lunar Lander, so the Sun should be the only light source on ""the Moon"" and in all pictures taken there.  In that case, the light should only come from one direction and all shadows should be cast in the opposite direction.  However, in dozens of official NASA photos there are shadows being cast in up to 3 directions simultaneously, often at up to 90 degree angles, which can only be the result of multiple light sources not present on the Moon.  Several pictures even show overhead spotlights reflecting in astronaut's helmets and multiple lens flares originating from two or more light sources. Analyzing several images from the 6 missions shows repeated background features (the exact same hills, dunes, and craters) being used over and over again in supposedly different places on the Moon, as well as visible foreground and backdrop lines indicative of a studio set.  In images from Apollo 11, Buzz Aldrin can be seen wearing different color gloves and different length boots in pictures that were supposedly taken within minutes of each other.  If Buzz was really in the vacuum of space in a pressurized spacesuit, he certainly would not have had the time or reason to de-pressurize and re-pressurize his suit just to make such fashion adjustments!  Some pictures show the lunar rover with no tracks anywhere around it, others show rover tracks all over the foreground while it is yet to be unpacked and unloaded!  A couple pictures even show what appear to be sneakers and a lady's heel tracks on the ""Moon"" in addition to the astronauts' boot prints! Another glaring mistake is that none of NASA's images or videos show stars in the background as they should, just complete blackness, likely because exact star maps as they should appear from the Moon would be nearly impossible to fake.  The testimony of different astronauts on different missions, in their autobiographies and interviews just muddies the waters even more, some of them bragging about the ""astonishingly brilliant light of the stars"" and others saying they ""don't remember seeing a single star while on the Moon!""  Such inconsistencies, and the fact that none of NASA's ""Moon"" pictures feature stars/planets in their appropriate positions, should raise a red flag that these astro-nots were not on the Moon. Many pictures of the ""Sun"" on the Moon are clearly spotlights and not the Sun.  Some images show studio lighting lens flares or studio lighting reflecting off a black background.  One image clearly shows a shadow on the ceiling of ""space"" as the Lunar Lander lifts off.  Many images show shadows of reticule crosshairs suspended in air over a print underneath proving them to be doctored and not originals as claimed.  Images of the Lunar Lander supposedly on the Moon shows a pathetic 1969 attempt at creating ""high-tech futuristic-looking"" equipment using what appears to be construction paper, gold foil, scotch tape, and metal shower rods.  The idea that the piece of junk shown in these official NASA photographs flew to the Moon and back is so ludicrous it's laughable.  Close-ups of the Lundar Lander footpads show them without a speck of dust on them and without a burn print under it's 10,000 pound thrusters, like it was just gently set down in place.  NASA scientists in their own documents were worried about the LEM falling into its own massive burn radius, yet there it sits with no burn print and spotless clean pads.  Even the astronauts' boot prints made deep impressions on the ""Moon dust"" yet the Lander's 10,000 pound thrusters left not a trace, no blast hole, and no dust on the pads. When the video evidence is examined, even more anomalies are found.  In certain frames, light pings can be seen reflecting off overhead stage-wires attached to astronauts' backpacks.  In one Apollo 16 clip an astronaut falls to his knees and is quickly jerked back up to his feet by what can only be an unseen wire hoisting him straight upwards.  One of the more obvious video anomalies is how several Apollo missions show American flags flapping around in the non-existent space-wind.  The ""Moon"" is supposed to have no atmosphere and so the flags should remain perfectly still but can often be seen moving quite boisterously.  Another interesting video anomaly is discovered by playing NASA's ""Moon"" footage at 2X speed then watching the astronauts walking, running, jumping or cruising around on their little buggy.  Without the speed adjustment there is a ""low-gravity"" illusion as the astronauts seem to float, drift, and glide slowly and smoothly along, but once they are seen at 2X speed it becomes clear that they are in ""normal-gravity"" walking, running, jumping and cruising at normal speeds!  They simply reduced the play-speed by 50% in post-production and voila, instant ""Moon"" motion. Not only is the Apollo video record fraught with fraud, but NASA claims the original Apollo 11 videos have conveniently disappeared from their records so no one can analyze them for authenticity!  You heard correctly, they spent over $30 billion of American taxpayer money traveling to ""the Moon,"" and then ""lost"" the video evidence!  Those blurry, ghostly black and white images shown on TV were purposely lousy because NASA insisted at the time that all TV networks must broadcast directly from a big-screen display in their operations room, a mandate which all the major networks accepted, and so what the public saw was just a video of a poorly magnified video, and now it is impossible to watch the original!  Not only have the Apollo 11 originals disappeared, but NASA claims to have lost all original audio tapes from the Apollo missions, and that their contractors have lost all prints/plans for the Lunar Rover, LEM Lander, and Apollo Ship Engines!  It even recently came out that when curators at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum investigated their ""Moon rock"" personally given to them by Armstrong and Aldrin in 1969, they found that it was actually just a worthless piece of petrified wood from Earth! In 1970 Freemason and Philosophy professor at St. Thomas' University, Leo Ferrari created ""The Flat Earth Society of Canada,"" which he soon shortened to simply, ""The Flat Earth Society.""  Unlike Samuel Shenton's International Flat Earth Research Society in every way, Leo Ferrari's Flat Earth Society treated the entire subject as a dead-pan joke, making a mockery of it, and even creating several intentionally false flat Earth arguments.  For example, Leo Ferarri would always bring a pumpkin-sized rock with him during interviews and lectures 
claiming he brought the stone back from the edge of our flat Earth!  He 
would say, with a huge smirk on his face, how his boat had fallen over 
the edge but he was luckily saved by hanging onto this rock.  Clearly, 
treating our flat Earth in this tongue-in-cheek way discouraged people 
from taking the matter seriously, and creating this fake ""Flat Earth Society"" was the Freemason's way of mitigating Shenton's IFERS genuine threat to their global deception. In 1971 Samuel Shenton passed away and the American former-airplane mechanic Charles K. Johnson took his place as president of IFERS.  Charles and his wife Marjory, like Lady Blount and many of the original Zetetic Society members were not only flat-Earthers, but outspoken vegetarians and anti-vivisectionists.  Charles and Marjory maintained a periodical called ""The Flat Earth News"" for many years where they printed articles about NASA's lies, geocentricity, flat Earth and vegetarianism.  Unlike Leo Ferrari and his mock society spreading disinformation, Charles Johnson was a genuine voice speaking out against the evils of the world. In 1974, when Johnson heard of Ferrari's budding organization, he 
decided to contact him and wrote a cordial letter requesting further 
information about his society, to which Ferrari never replied.  Two 
years later Johnson wrote another polite letter saying, how he was 
""delighted by the prospect of a like-minded campaigner,"" and said how it
 was ""a very happy day"" when he learned of Ferrari's society.  ""I feel 
sure at the core we can't be too far apart in aims,"" Johnson wrote, ""I 
do try to practice what I preach, to think and seek and search out 
reasonable ideas and concepts.""  He closed saying that ""he could hardly 
wait"" to hear from Ferrari and hoped very much he would please reply.  
After six months without a response, Johnson wrote one more time, 
explaining again his sole purpose to ""enlarge his view"" and ""getting and
 holding onto the facts,"" which would benefit himself, and in time, the 
rest of the world.  He requested a reply and a copy of Ferrari's FES 
magazine.  In conclusion Johnson signed ""thanks from the bottom of my 
heart,"" in advance, but warned that if Ferrari insisted on ignoring him 
once again, ""I will then know for sure that you are some kind of enemy of the
 Flat Earth work.""  Eventually Ferrari did reply this time, but not with
 a message or magazine as requested, he simply enclosed an FES 
paid-application form. Johnson investigated Ferrari's organization further and found that he 
was using ""the flat earth idea as a gimmick to entertain and promote the
 atheistic society.""  From then on, Johnson worked hard to expand his 
IFERS and constantly for the rest of his life exposed Ferrari's FES, 
calling him a ""false prophet guilty of muddying the waters of truth.""  
Near the end of his life, tragically Johnson's house burned down along 
with all the flat Earth materials he and Shenton had collected over 
their lifetimes.  Until his dying day, Johnson claimed the fire to be 
the result of arson by a NASA agent he had seen snooping around. Apparently finished with their ""Moon"" landing propaganda, starting in 1976 NASA began faking ""Mars"" landings instead.  To begin with, the ""planets"" (formerly known as ""wandering stars"") are not terrestrial Earth-like habitations capable of landing anything on!  The Sun, Moon and stars are all simply luminaries, celestial lights relatively close to Earth, and not something tangibly solid that humans could ever walk on.  This is painfully obvious to anyone with functioning eye-balls and a telescope or Nikon P900 camera, but NASA continues to this day to publish thousands of fake CGI images claiming to come from Mars. Even assuming Mars was an actual spherical desert planet as NASA claims, it is impossible for them to have safely landed the probes based on their own trials and statistics.  They say the surface pressure on Mars is only 3/10th of 1% the surface pressure on Earth, and equivalent to the pressure at about 23 miles above Earth.  There is not enough air matter at that pressure, however, to provide any lift for opening and billowing out the parachutes NASA uses to land its Mars probes.  No parachute ever devised has been able to successfully deploy at that altitude; they simply stream straight back then never fill the rest of the way down.  Joe Kittenger's record highest, fastest, and longest parachute dive from the Earth's upper atmosphere had him free-falling from only 19 miles high for 15 minutes at 767mph and his drogue chute proved useless and offered no deceleration.  Yet NASA would have us believe, for example, that Phoenix's parachute managed to somehow slow it down from 12,738mph to 123mph in just 2.86 minutes before its final landing.  In other words, NASA is claiming to do something on ""Mars"" millions of miles away by remote control something that we have no evidence is even possible on Earth at significantly lower altitude and 16 times slower speed! To this day NASA continues to fake Mars landings and more government space agencies around the world including Russia, China, Japan, France, India and others are following the same Freemasonic model of fleecing their populations of taxpayer money to fund programs that provide the public nothing but propaganda.  NASA and other space agencies rocket launches never even go straight up.  Every rocket forms a parabolic curve, peaks out, and inevitably starts falling back to Earth.  The rockets which are declared ""successful"" are those few which don't explode or start falling too soon but make it out of range of spectator view before crashing down into restricted waters and recovered.  There is no magic altitude where rockets or anything else can simply go up, up, up and then suddenly just start ""free-floating"" in space.  This is all science-fiction illusion created by wires, green-screens, dark pools, some permed hair and Zero-G planes. In 1998 NASA claimed to have sent up the first piece of the ISS, International Space Station.  They have been caught however, time and again with air bubbles forming and floating off in their official ""outer-space"" footage.   Astronauts have also been caught using scuba-space-gear, kicking their 
legs to move, and astronaut Luca Parmitano even almost drowned when 
water started filling up his helmet while allegedly on a “space-walk.”  
It is admitted that astronauts train for their “space-walks” in 
under-water training facilities like NASA’s “Neutral Buoyancy Lab,” but 
what is obvious from their “space bubbles,” and other blunders is that 
all official “space-walk” footage is also fake and filmed under-water. Analysis of many interior videos from the “International Space Station,”
 have shown the use of camera-tricks such as green-screens, harnesses 
and even wildly permed hair to achieve a zero-gravity type effect.  
Footage of astronauts seemingly floating in the zero-gravity of their 
“space station” is indistinguishable from “vomit comet” Zero-G airplane 
footage.  By flying parabolic maneuvers this Zero-G floating effect can 
be achieved over and over again then edited together.  For longer uncut 
shots, NASA has been caught using simple wires and green screen 
technology. In 2001 Charles K. Johnson died and having lost all his flat Earth material and correspondence in his house fire, the IFERS was officially finished.  Leo Ferrari's farcical Flat Earth Society, on the other hand, continued operation as usual making a mockery of the flat Earth subject.  In 2004 the reigns of FES presidency were handed over to Daniel Shenton (of no relation to genuine flat-Earther Samuel Shenton) who, true to Ferrari's example, maintains the Flat Earth Society website to this day, where they purport such fantastical purposeful disinformation as the flat Earth disc constantly rising upwards forever through the universe to account for gravity.  Their sole purpose, as Charles Johnson correctly stated, is clearly to poison the well and muddy the waters of truth. In 2008 teacher and author Eric Dubay (that's me) began a website and published a book titled The Atlantean Conspiracy which exposed among many other things, Freemasonry, the fake Moon Landings, Geocentricity, and even featured a quote from IFERS President Charles K. Johnson.  At the time I had already read Samuel Rowbotham and William Carpenter’s 
old 19th century flat Earth books, and though personally still on the 
fence regarding the shape of the Earth, I was confident they were 
correct about the location (or Geocentricity) of Earth, so I wrote about
 it. In 2009, after watching Alex Jones interview and praise several NASA 
astronauts on his show, I wrote an article and sent a message to him and
 his producers about the Moon Landing Hoax and included a link to Samuel
 Rowbotham’s flat Earth book for them to read.  Alex even mentioned this
 on-air the next day and called me a “flat-Earther” who “thinks he’s 
covering up some Atlantean Conspiracy,” (the title of my book and 
website). For the next several years I continued writing books/articles about 
various conspiracies and worked on building a huge social media 
presence.  By making multiple accounts, adding as many friends/followers
 as possible, joining and posting to as many groups and pages as 
possible, over the course of a few years I began building up very large 
followings on Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Twitter, StumbleUpon, 
PInterest, Tsu and many other sites.  To give you an example of their 
efficacy you can see here my main Google Plus account with over
 135 million views and my secondary one with over 87 million. In mid-2011, a professional artist, comedian and Hollywood actor named Math Powerland, claiming to also be an ex-NASA whistle-blower, created ""TheNASAChannel"" on Youtube.  He made a few decent videos
 exposing NASA image fakery, but his channel certainly did not contain 
many flat Earth proofs or evidence, and there are more videos of him 
ranting about Axe deodorant, hookers on Tinder, his championship sexual 
prowess, and other irrelevant topics than there are actually exposing the flat 
Earth.  For example, see his recent video entitled ""The History of the Flat Earth,"" the same name and comparable length as the video you are watching now, but contains almost no content relating to history or the flat Earth, just him venting his various political frustrations.   In short, anyone visiting his channel would NOT become a flat 
Earther and would be more likely turned off from the subject due to his 
manic ranting style and lack of factual content. In November of 2014, after years of researching and writing, I released my book ""The Flat Earth Conspiracy,"" the first pro-flat-Earth book written in nearly 50 years.  I simultaneously released a ""Flat Earth Conspiracy Documentary"" on YouTube, began giving radio interviews, and published several influential articles on the subject.  Within a very short space of time the ""Flat Earth"" keyword saw a 600% rise in activity and Google search results jumped from a few thousand to over 21 million!  Soon after this, just as Johnson had experienced with Ferrari, I noticed a wave of disingenuous so-called flat-Earthers flooding into the movement with the obvious intent to muddy the waters. For example, when I began writing my book “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” I came across Paul Michael Bales on Facebook, a recent flat Earth convert 
who had been collecting a library of old original flat Earth books and 
letters.  Hoping to find some good reference material, I messaged him 
asking for recommended titles and he told me a few choice books to read.  The full extent of our interaction consisted of a short Facebook 
conversation, yet curiously after my book was published and the flat 
Earth movement started growing, Paul began stating publicly that he was 
“the Morpheus to my Neo” and that he “taught me everything I know about 
the flat Earth.”  He even made the ludicrous claim that my book was 
“plagiarized from old Facebook posts of his!”  Matt Boylan a.k.a. Math Powerland also jumped 
in and had the gall to say that “my entire book was plagiarized from his
 information,” which is equally laughable considering he and “his 
information” are only mentioned in 2 paragraphs of my 252 page book.  
Needless to say, both of their claims are baseless and go to show how 
desperate they are to receive credit where it is not due. You can also see from this Google analytics chart that the Flat Earth 
keyword had not made any significant change in 2011 since the launch of 
Matt’s YouTube channel, nor in late 2012/early 2013 when Paul claims to 
have gotten his start.  The moment when the Flat Earth tides shifted and
 the exponential growth of the movement began was clearly around and 
after November 2014, the exact month when I exploded all of my flat 
Earth research onto the internet.  In November 2014, I published the 
first pro-flat Earth book written in 50 years, “The Flat Earth 
Conspiracy,” I also published several popular articles on the subject, 
uploaded the most popular “Flat Earth Conspiracy” documentary on 
YouTube, began giving radio interviews, and soon re-started Charles 
Johnson’s IFERS (The International Flat Earth Research Society) and published my most successful book, ""200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball"" which has now been translated into 12 foreign languages and read by millions worldwide.  These 
simultaneous actions, my intentional exploding of credible flat Earth 
information onto the internet all at once, which I had been preparing 
for the entire year before, are undoubtedly the catalyst behind the 
exponential growth curve seen beginning here. Later on, around 
March 2015, recent flat Earth convert Mark Sargent came out of nowhere, 
began uploading new flat Earth videos every day, uploading new 
interviews several times per week, got offered his own radio show, 
started being heralded by many as “the King of flat Earth,” and credited
 with starting the modern flat Earth revival.  At first I was glad to 
have him on-board until the cracks began to show and the clear 
disinformation campaign began.  Mark claimed the Moon and stars were 
“holographic projections” maintained by alleged “dome-builders” who keep
 us inside a “Truman show” enclosed structure among much other 
non-sense.  He even lied about me in several interviews including one 
where he claimed that I promoted the idea of a constantly rising flat 
Earth to account for gravity, when in fact I constantly expose this 
false concept as being disinformation.  Mark was, and continues to be, the Leo Ferrari to my Charles Johnson.  In fact, Mark has even bragged several times about being a card-carrying member of Ferrari's farcical organization. By New Years Eve 2016 our new IFERS had gained over 3,000 members and was receiving 50,000 hits monthly when it was suddenly and without warning or explanation deleted from the internet.  As the administrators and myself quickly worked on salvaging our material and creating a new site, the obvious parallels to Johnson losing everything in his NASA-agent initiated house fire were noteworthy.  Around the same time two disingenuous flat-Earth channels issued two fraudulent copyright strikes against me which I managed to overturn by filing legal counter-claims against them.  YouTube itself also began a program of regularly unsubscribing old subscribers of mine, and lowering view-counts of popular videos.  Shortly after that, Facebook also decided to jump on the ""Eric Dubay 
censorship bandwagon"" by deleting my account, all my pages, and giving 
my Atlantean Conspiracy group directly over to a team of Freemason shills 
who still administrate it to this day filling the group with nothing but
 death threats to me, pictures of Masonic goats, and ridiculous 
belittling memes.  After re-registering for new accounts and 
accumulating my friends lists again, Facebook has now deleted two more 
profiles, and I am currently on my fourth still trying my best to spread the word! In 2016 the movement continued to grow, with many more genuine flat-Earthers taking up the reigns and exposing the truth online, as well as many more disingenous shills continuing to poison the well with misinformation.  The new IFERS began thriving with more monthly visitors than ever before.  Many new flat Earth YouTube channels began creating and mirroring excellent content.  Now at the turn of 2017 I am truly pleased with the rapid growth of this wonderful flat Earth movement, and encourage everyone to please help speak out, share this video, and spread the good word, as we look forward to a future where humanity is finally free from this grandest of all deceptions."
26,Dear Spinning Ball Earth Believer,"Hello.  My name is Eric Dubay and I'm a Flat Earther.  Contrary to what you have been told to believe about me by the mainstream media, the government education system, and society in general, I am not an idiot, uneducated, or a religious zealot.  I am a college graduate, spent 7 years teaching at a prestigious University, have published 5 books, and am not a follower of any religion.  I was once a spinning ball Earth believer like yourself.  In fact, the only difference between Spinning Ball Earthers and Flat Earthers, is that Flat Earthers have done their research.  Of course, however, you will be told the opposite, that Flat Earthers are uneducated morons unaware of modern scientific theories, but the reality is every Flat Earther is well educated regarding the Spinning Ball Earth fantasy presented by NASA, taught in schools, and accepted as gospel truth by the gullible masses.  In fact, you will find the average Flat Earther is far more knowledgeable about the Spinning Ball Earth we're supposedly living on than the average Spinning Ball Earth believer!  This is because Flat Earthers are all people who attempted to prove for themselves whether or not Earth is the way modern scientific and astronomical theory preaches, and discovered that it most certainly is not. There are hundreds of proofs and scientific experiments which have conclusively shown the Earth to be a stationary plane, but you have never and will never hear about these heavily censored experiments in our controlled media.  You never hear of the Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Sagnac, Kantor, and Airy experiments, for example, all of which proved the Earth to be motionless.  You also never hear of the Rowbotham, Blount, or Carpenter experiments all of which proved the Earth to be a level plane devoid of any curvature.  Instead you are repeatedly shown NASA images of a spinning ball Earth and astronauts in zero-G space.  You are told the oceans curve around and stick to the underside of a spinning ball thanks to Newton's magical gravity.  You are told Eratosthenes measured shadows to prove the ball, and Magellan circumnavigated the ball.  Again, us Flat Earthers are well aware of the supposed proofs and alleged evidence we are given regarding the spinning ball Earth fantasy.  The difference is we have further analyzed these supposed proofs and found glaring holes in them even larger than the size of NASA's annual budget. I have personally debunked every such claim of supposed spinning ball Earth evidence I could find in my book "" "" in my book of the same title.  I will not re-iterate myself here as you can read these online for free now in over a dozen languages, but suffice to say, there is no aspect of the spinning globe model that stands up to critical scrutiny, and every alleged proof offered is easily refuted.  The spinning globe and every argument used to defend it is simply pseudo-science masquerading as truth.  The pictures and videos presented to the public by NASA and other government space agencies are as real as a Hollywood motion picture and as scientific as science-fiction.  Science facts, on the other hand, prove the flat Earth. For example, it is the natural physics of all fluids to remain perfectly level and flat until disturbed in some way.  If dammed up and released, all liquids will quickly disperse in every unobstructed direction until finding their new level.  This ever-present, never-broken law of physics is so reliable that builders use water spirit-levels to level all their constructions.  When you look out at the sea-horizon, from as high as amateur balloons and rockets have ever gone, the water line always remains completely level and flat.  If, however, the Earth is a spinning ball as NASA and modern astronomy claim, then somehow the massive oceans must all in defiance of physics, curve thousands of miles around an irregular pear-shaped oblate spheroid.  In reality, measurements have been repeatedly taken throughout history until modern times using lasers, levels, sextants and theodolites to test for Earth's supposed curvature and every time have proven what our eyes and experience tell us to be true: The Earth simply does not curve downwards 8 inches per mile squared as dictated by spherical trigonometry and NASA's own calculations for a globe Earth 24,900 miles in equatorial circumference.  This mythical curvature exists only in the fisheye lens footage they constantly film and the fake CG images of Earth they constantly propagate. Now, dear Spinning Ball Earth believer, there is much more you must learn and even more that you must unlearn to understand fully the depth of this deception.  It will take more than just a few minutes of Flat Earth research to overcome a lifetime of indoctrination, but I implore you to do just that.  Try and prove to yourself whether or not the spinning ball Earth we are taught to believe since kindergarten is in fact a reality.  I can speak on behalf of every Flat Earther when I say that's exactly what we did.  We did our due diligence in researching and proving one way or the other whether this seemingly flat, motionless plane we all stand upon is actually a tilting, wobbling, rotating and revolving pear-shaped oblate spheroid, hurdling around the Sun, or whether everything is actually just as it seems:  Water always remains level and flat, the horizon always remains level and flat, the Earth is motionless, just as it seems, and the Sun, Moon and stars all revolve over and around us, just as it appears.  I encourage you to please explore this fascinating subject for yourself by viewing the many other Flat Earth documentaries and interviews on my YouTube channel and visiting The International Flat Earth Research Society at"
27,Operation: Spread Flat Earth Truth,"At the moment, just like every other 4 years, the gullible masses are being corralled and duped by the Jewish Freemasonic mafia puppet-show known as U.S. elections into voting for one of two equally-terrible long ago bought and paid for politicians, thinking their ceremonial tick at the ballot box is the epitome of effective political activism for members of the so-called ""free"" world.  In reality, however, a cursory look into the electoral college, voting fraud, and the process of candidacy will reveal the dismal truth and make it abundantly clear, that your ability to tick a box once every four years, has absolutely no effect over who rules and who makes the rules.  Presidents are puppets while the true rulers rule from behind the scenes through coercion, manipulation, deception, bribery, blackmail, forgery, murder, war and other unsavory methods in operations never disclosed to the sheepish public.  The real rulers are those who control our monetary system and the mainstream media.  A tiny handful of people made up mostly of Jews, Freemasons, and Jewish Freemasons, run and control the vast majority of the world's banks and media.  Spreading awareness of this one fact alone, and make no mistake it is an , is more important, relevant, and catalytic to bringing about real positive political change than every ballot box you have ever ticked. For daring to spread this most important and overlooked truth, I have received death threats, lost friends and family members, had my forum shut down, and been kicked off Facebook thrice and counting.  As damning and easily provable as is this fact of Jewish Freemason control, there is one other incredible fact which has also been held from humanity for 500 years now.  This fact is even more damning and more easily provable, and is also a direct result of the Jewish Freemason control over the minds of the masses worldwide.  It is the most marginalized, ridiculed, censored and hidden fact in history.  If this fact was made known to the world at large, just this one fact, has the power to completely transform the world and everyone in it for the better, holistically, in a myriad of ways.  Our rulers are well aware of this, and that is exactly why this truth has been held from us so expertly for so long.  It is about the truth of who we are, where we come from, the actual position and significance of humans, Earth, the Sun, Moon, and stars. The fact is:  The Earth is flat and motionless.  That is all.  And that is the revelation that will finally break the matrix.  You have been taught from the earliest ages that you live on a spinning ball.  That NASA has sent men to the Moon, that satellites are hovering in perpetual orbit overhead, that an International Space Station contains astronauts free-floating above us, that the Earth is a ball that tilts, wobbles, spins on its axis and revolves around the Sun, and that all these and you are the result of a Big Bang cosmogenic explosion 14 billion years ago which created everything out of nothing.  Yet nothing could be farther from the truth. The truth is simple and easily proven.  You can see for yourself the horizon is always flat and you can measure using sextants, theodolites, and lasers to prove the Earth and its massive oceans have absolutely no curvature whatsoever.  You can feel for yourself that the Earth beneath you is motionless and you can measure as Michelson, Morley, Gale, Sagnac, Airy and other scientists  have to prove that the Earth is completely motionless.  That's right.  It has been long proven by several scientific experiments, even in the elitist ""peer-reviewed journals"" you critics constantly harp on about, that the Earth is a stationary plane.  The reason you haven't heard about it before is because the media is controlled by the same people who created this deception.  The only time you have ever heard a ""Flat Earther"" mentioned in the media, it was in jest or ridicule.  The only thing you have ever heard about ""Flat Earth"" is that its adherents are ignorant idiots.  Sorry to burst your space bubble, but if you still think you're living on a spinning ball in 2016, you my friend, are the ignorant one. Millions of people worldwide are waking up to this incredible re-discovery and this ""Flat Earth movement"" has the potential to bring about positive change on a unprecedented level.  Like a balloon held underwater for 500 years, the momentum of truth rising to the surface is causing and will continue to cause huge ripples in the control system.  As the spinning ball-Earth is finally being exposed worldwide for the 500 
year deception it was, Earth's entire population is suddenly being faced 
with the reality that every government, every space agency, university, 
secret society, religious organization, mainstream and alternative media
 outlet have ALL been duplicitous in propping up a monstrous 
manipulation to fleece and control the masses. The resulting mass mental
 exodus away from the control system is exactly what humanity needs. 
Once the flat Earth truth gets out, these lying politicians, spokesmen, 
reporters and teachers suddenly change from being heralded voices of 
authority to being ridiculed, shunned and denounced as they deserve. 
Once the flat Earth truth gets out, these governments, universities, 
media outlets and other entangled organizations which have long been 
hard at work weaving this multi-generational cosmological myth, suddenly 
and completely lose all credibility. Once the truth of our flat Earth 
gets out, so does the truth of these few elite families/societies who 
have kept this most important and fundamental reality from us for these 
hundreds of years! Essentially, once the flat Earth truth gets out, so 
does every other important truth by proxy, because this 
""mother-of-all-conspiracies"" holds under its umbrella literally ALL of 
the other conspiracies, and exposes them. As a result of deeply understanding this and wanting to bring about a better world, it has become my life mission to spread the flat Earth truth to everyone.  I have written two books on the subject, ""The Flat Earth Conspiracy"" and ""200 Proofs the Earth is Not a Spinning Ball.""  I have re-started the International Flat Earth Research Society and maintain a website with hundreds of articles on the subject.  I have done flat Earth radio interviews, made flat Earth FAQs, flat Earth shirts, written flat Earth rap songs, audio/video books, documentaries, and created every other kind of media I can think of to try and promote this message.  Now in just a few short years, thanks to the efforts of the rapidly growing flat Earth community, this has gone from a completely unknown, undiscussed topic to one of the highest ranked google search terms on the internet with tens of millions of hits monthly.  If you still haven't done your due diligence in researching to know for yourself 100% that you are living on a flat, stationary plane, please look into the links provided.  And for those of you who do know, I implore you to help my mission Operation: Spread Flat Earth Truth. Simply knowing the truth yourself will not and cannot save the world.  The only way to save the world is for the whole world to know the truth.  As a means to that end, the most important type of activism anyone can be doing right now is spreading these important truths on a mass scale.  There are innumerable creative ways to help achieve this; the following are several effective methods myself or friends have had success with: 1. Conversation:  One of the best ways to engage people with the flat reality is through conversation.  Asking leading questions, dropping hints, or just telling people various proofs and evidences is a great way to wake people up.  This only works, however, if you are very knowledgeable about the subject yourself and able to answer every possible question without hesitation like the liars at NASA do. 2. Viewing Parties:  Another good way to engage people is by getting them to agree to sit down and watch an informative documentary on the subject such as my videos ""The World's Biggest Secret,"" or ""The Masonic Matrix Manipulators""  After watching you can then do your best to field any questions people may have. 3. Book Gifting:  A great indirect way of engaging people is by buying and giving them copies of ""The Flat Earth Conspiracy"" and ""200 Proofs the Earth is Not a Spinning Ball"" or other good books on the subject.  If you own flat Earth books yourself, be sure to let friends and family borrow them as well. 4. School Projects:  If you are currently in school or university, a great way to expose this information is by writing essays or doing projects which tackle various aspects of ball-Earth pseudo-science or expose true flat Earth findings. 5. Social Media:  I have had great success using social media to spread flat Earth truth.  Simply create accounts with all the big social media sites like Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Reddit, StumbleUpon etc., join relevant groups and pages, follow people interested in related subjects, and post the best flat Earth material you can find to as many places as you can, as often as you can.  Don't bother arguing with the trolls and closed-minds that will inevitably hound you, but rather focus on dissemination, spreading the message far and wide.  If people ask genuine questions, be sure to answer, but anyone merely looking to ridicule should be left alone to talk with themselves. 6. Use YouTube and Other Video Sharing Sites:  With 13 million hits and growing, my YouTube channel has done an excellent job spreading this message.  We need more people to start flat Earth YouTube and other video sharing site channels, however, either creating original content or just re-uploading other good content.  I personally have given everyone permission to use any/all of my content to help spread the word.  Once you upload a new video to YouTube, then go to all your social media accounts and post each new video to all the relevant pages, groups and timelines you can. 7. Translations:  For multi-lingual flat Earthers, one of the best things you can do is help translate good flat Earth material into your native tongue.  My book ""200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball"" has now been translated into 12 different languages and counting, reaching people who would otherwise never have a chance of understanding this material, the majority of which currently exists only in English. 8. Graffiti/Artwork:  Another great method of spreading the word is through artwork or graffiti.  Writing important search terms or keywords and phrases on paper money is also very effective.  On the borders of your dollar bills, simply write AtlanteanConspiracy.com, IFERS.123.st, the Earth is Flat!, Google Flat Earth, Google Eric Dubay, or other such messages. 9. Pamphleteering/stickers:  Creating small brochures or stickers with flat Earth information on them and handing them out in public spaces is an excellent way to spread the word.  Compile several photo proofs or text proofs and put them in an easily printable and readable format then hand out as many as you can. 10:  Radio/TV Show Call ins:  Many different TV and radio shows give their viewers/listeners the opportunity to call in and talk with the host about certain subjects.  A great way to spread the word is either by calling into these shows and engaging them on the subject on the spot, or contacting their producers before-hand and seeing if you could actually be interviewed. There are an infinite number of creative ways we can spread this most important message, but the key is numbers and consistency.  We need to hit a critical-mass tipping-point of awakened individuals dedicated to helping unplug everyone else from the spinning ball-Earth matrix.  If you have figured out the truth of our flat Earth and realize the amazing positive implications of this being exposed worldwide, please join me on my mission to help spread flat Earth truth to the entire flat world."
28,The Flat Earth Society is Controlled Opposition!,"group 
that mixes truth with lies and satire to discredit genuine flat Earth 
research, a job they have been doing for a long time now.  Founded in 1970 by Leo Ferrari, a suspected Freemason and philosophy professor at St. Thomas' University, Leo spent his life making a mockery of the .  Though he passed away in 2010, his Flat Earth Society still exists today online as a website/forum which, still true to form, purports several false flat-Earth arguments and treats the entire subject as a dead-pan joke. In 1956 a genuine truth-seeker and flat-Earth researcher, Samuel Shenton, had started the IFERS (International Flat Earth Research Society) and was making quite an impact with his publications and interviews, revealing the truth of our flat Earth to the masses.  The globalists attempted to ignore the threat posed by Shenton for over a decade before finally creating their competing, farcical controlled opposition FES (Flat Earth Society) which has spent the past 45 years steering all flat-Earth inquiry into the realms of satire and sarcasm. Leo Ferrari's pumpkin-sized rock he
 would always take during 
interviews and lectures claiming he brought the stone back from the edge of our flat
 Earth!  He would say, with a huge smirk on his face, how his boat had 
fallen over the edge but he was luckily saved by hanging onto this rock.  
Clearly, treating our flat Earth in this tongue-in-cheek way discouraged
 people from taking the matter seriously. Ferrari's
 entire schtick involved approaching the flat Earth subject from every 
angle EXCEPT the rational and scientific.  For example, he published a 
series of articles including ""The Global Fallacy as a Cause 
of Racial Prejudice,"" arguing that people in countries at the 
top of the globe felt superior to those at the bottom, when in fact 
there was no top or bottom to the world, so, ""even if one 
assumed that the world was spherical, the 'top' and 'bottom' have been 
arbitrarily selected, resulting in racial discrimination against those 
in the south.  How can the globularists, their hirelings and dupes, 
seriously claim to believe that all men are created equal when they 
teach that some men are eternally fated to hang like bats from the 
bottom of a globe on which other men stand upright?  The only solution 
is a flat Earth!""  So instead of presenting measurements or experiments, instead of presenting any proofs or evidence, Ferrari would often simply argue the flat Earth as a serendipitous satirical solution to social problems. In a famous 1971 CBC interview Ferrari was asked, ""how do you 
explain the fact that the Earth appears round in the pictures taken from
 space by the astronauts?""  Instead of answering and addressing the , Ferrari replied, ""Simple.  No doubt 
you're familiar with Einstein's theory of the curvature of space.  If 
space is curved - and modern physics is based on that assumption - the 
Earth, from space, would appear circular.  It's a simple optical 
illusion.""  This convoluted, pandering answer really is no answer at all
 and serves only to make the listener cock their head and raise an 
eyebrow. Around this time, Charles K. Johnson, another genuine flat-Earther, took over the IFERS from the recently deceased Shenton.  He and his wife Marjory, along with being flat-Earthers, were also vegetarians and anti-vivisectionist activists who campaigned for better treatment of .  In 1974, when Johnson heard of Ferrari's budding organization, he decided to contact him and wrote a cordial letter requesting further information about his society, to which Ferrari never replied.  Two years later Johnson wrote another polite letter saying, how he was ""delighted by the prospect of a like-minded campaigner,"" and said how it was ""a very happy day"" when he learned of Ferrari's society.  ""I feel sure at the core we can't be too far apart in aims,"" Johnson wrote, ""I do try to practice what I preach, to think and seek and search out reasonable ideas and concepts.""  He closed saying that ""he could hardly wait"" to hear from Ferrari and hoped very much he would please reply.  After six months without a response, Johnson wrote one more time, explaining again his sole purpose to ""enlarge his view"" and ""getting and holding onto the facts,"" which would benefit himself, and in time, the rest of the world.  He requested a reply and a copy of Ferrari's FES magazine.  In conclusion Johnson signed ""thanks from the bottom of my heart,"" in advance, but warned that if Ferrari insisted on ignoring him once again, ""I will then know for sure .""  Eventually Ferrari did reply this time, but not with a message or magazine as requested, he simply enclosed a FES paid-application form. Johnson investigated Ferrari's organization further and found that he was using ""the flat earth idea as a gimmick to entertain and promote the atheistic society.""  From then on, Johnson worked hard to expand his IFERS and constantly for the rest of his life exposed Ferrari's FES, calling him a ""false prophet guilty of muddying the waters of truth.""  Near the end of his life, tragically Johnson's house burned down along with all the flat Earth materials he and Shenton had collected over their lifetimes.  Until his dying day, Johnson claimed the fire to be the result of arson by a NASA agent he had seen snooping around. Nowadays the IFERS has disappeared and only
 Ferrari's FES exists as a website and message 
board maintained by moderators who, following in the 
footsteps of Ferrari, make a mockery of the whole thing and turn every 
thread into a joke deterring any serious flat Earth researcher from 
pursuing further.  The only redeeming aspect of their website is the they maintain, which is actually quite good.  The current President, Daniel Shenton, (coincidentally NO relation to the genuine flat-Earther and IFERS founder Samuel Shenton) can be heard in the following clip, still ""muddying the waters of truth,"" with several false flat Earth arguments: Notice he says he is ""not sure about the Sun, Moon and planets, but that they're probably spheres, but it's definitely not proven, I think.""  He flip-flops his answers and expertly fumbles his words as if intentionally trying to sound scatter-brained.  Compare and contrast this shill with genuine flat Earth researchers like myself who will tell you unequivocally that capable of landing on as the Freemasons at NASA would have you believe.  He then goes on saying ""the effects of gravity, I feel, could be simulated by the disc Earth moving upwards, accelerating upwards at 9.8 meters per second, would have the same effects of what people traditionally think of as gravity.""  This ridiculous false flat-Earth argument also appears on Wikipedia and the FES homepage.  It is provably wrong as the ""upwards accelerating disc"" would smash into all helicopters, planes and hot-air balloons making sustained flight of any kind impossible, but they purposely promote these strawman arguments so flat Earth neophytes will rightly laugh off their dumb explanations, and then following suit, write off the entire subject. To combat Ferrari's Flat Earth Society controlled opposition forum, and in memory of Samuel Shenton, Charles Johnson, and other true flat Earth researchers of the past I have now (re) !  Please join up and help make this a useful and informative board!  Also help join and share my new"
29,The World's Biggest Secret,Do you want to know a secret?  I'm going to tell you the biggest and oldest secret kept for 500 years by the biggest and oldest secret society in the world:
30,Is the Earth Actually Flat?,"I am being featured in Spain's QR magazine this month with an interview I gave concerning our flat, motionless Earth.  Overall I thought the questions were good, however they chose an odd image from one of my rap videos to represent me, and the magazine's editors interestingly omitted one and only one word from the actual interview:  The final paragraph should read ""The JEWS, Jesuits, Freemasons and other embedded secret societies,"" though they decided to take out the word ""Jews"" because quote, ""that leaves us as a company open to attack and highly publicized criticism.""  As Voltaire said, ""to learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize."" QR - How long have you been researching the Flat Earth Theory, and what sparked your interest in the first place? I have been researching the NASA Moon and Mars landing hoaxes, Geocentricism, Flat Earth and other conspiracies for the better part of a decade and have since written 5 books, maintain a popular conspiracy website, and am President of the .  I never fully bought the spinning ball-Earth model presented to us at school and reading the historical flat Earthers like Samuel Rowbotham, Thomas Winship, William Carpenter, Lady Blount, Gerard Hickson, David Wardlaw Scott, and confirming their experiments and observations for myself, it became overwhelmingly obvious that flat Earth is not simply a theory. QR - Contrary to all of the theories that the earth is round, why are you convinced otherwise? What evidence do you have to support your arguments? We have the evidence of our senses and every experiment ever devised to test for Earth’s alleged curvature or motion!  The horizon always remains flat 360 degrees around you and rises to the eye of the observer no matter how high you ascend.  All amateur balloons and rockets to altitudes of over 20 miles high watch the flat horizon rise with the level of the observer/camera all the way up.  On a spherical Earth, no matter how large, the horizon would stay where it was and you would have to look down to see it more and more the further you ascended.  You will never look down at the horizon however, and it will always remain completely flat 360 degrees around.  Only in NASA’s fake CGI footage or that filmed through a wide-angle lens do we ever see the supposed “curvature” of the Earth.  My latest book entitled “200 Proofs the Earth is Not a Spinning Ball” contains 200 more proofs that the Earth is flat and motionless, along with my previous book “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” which contains many more. QR - When people have been into space, why is it do you think that they did not identify the earth as being flat? Outer space is a science-fiction myth woven by lying Freemasons with some rockets, computer graphics, and a multi-billion dollar taxpayer-funded budget.  Astro-nots are merely Freemasonic actors playing out their role in propagandizing the public into believing their nihilistic, atheistic, heliocentric cosmology.  Astronauts are fully aware of the deception they are participating in and “do not identify the earth as being flat” because they are sworn paid liars doing a job. Everything in the heavens revolves over and around us just as it appears.  The Sun and Moon are similar sized discs tracing similar paths over and around the flat, motionless Earth.  The “planets” which were always known as the “wandering stars,” are not physical spherical terra firma worlds as presented to us in NASA’s many fake CGI videos, but are merely tiny lights in the sky which differ from the fixed stars in their relative motions only.  Polaris remains perfectly fixed directly over the North Pole and all the other stars rotate perfect circles around it, with their constellations not moving out of position for thousands of years, yet another proof of geocentricism, impossible in the heliocentric spinning ball model. The Sun and Moon are much closer and smaller than we are told (32 miles in diameter, under 3000 miles high, as measured by sextants) and they revolve over and around us creating a spotlight effect creating the day and night.  The Sun’s circular orbit expands and contracts every six months, beginning at the Tropic of Cancer at 23.5 degrees North latitude on the Summer Solstice then slowly widening and revolving faster until it reaches the Tropic of Capricorn at 23.5 degrees South latitude on the Winter Solstice then slowly narrowing and revolving slower until it begins the process anew at the Summer Solstice.  These changes in the Sun’s path and speed are what cause the seasons. I could similarly ask NASA and modern astronomers, “if outer-space is indeed real, where does it start and end, and why can’t we go beyond that?”  Antarctica is not the tiny ice-continent found confined to the underside of astronomer’s globes, but is rather a gigantic ice wall/plateau 200 feet tall that surrounds the Earth and holds the oceans in 360 degrees around us.  How far the Antarctic ice extends southwards and whether it terminates in an edge, barrier/firmament, or whether it is infinite is currently unknown and unknowable to the public thanks to the Antarctic Treaty which prevents ordinary people from independent exploration of Antarctica. The oceans are all connected, are completely flat (it’s called “sea-level” for a reason), and are held in by the surrounding Antarctic ice wall/plateau.  How far the Antarctic ice extends southwards and how it terminates are still unknown to the public at this time. This is another question which even NASA refuses to answer.  They claim that at some undetermined height, “gravity” becomes weaker and weaker until it magically gives way to “outer-space” which is a vacuum which allow astronauts to free-float forever without falling back down.  First of all, it is physically and philosophically impossible for “infinite non-gravitized vacuum space” to exist adjacent to and not separated in any way from non-vacuum, gravitized atmosphere.  Secondly, no amateur rocket, balloon, or other technology has ever been able to reach this alleged height where instead of falling back down to Earth like a skydiver, people are able to simply free-float.  This is because astro-nots are not in outer-space at all and are simply filming the free-floating effect using camera tricks, green screens, wires, dark pools, and so-called “zero-g planes.”  The reality is as the old adage states, “what goes up, must come down,” and not because of “gravity” but because objects always rise/fall based on the relative densities of their surroundings.  A helium balloon rises upwards because it is lighter than the oxygen, nitrogen and other elements in the air surrounding it.  A rock drops right to the ground because it is denser than the air surrounding it.  That is all.  The helium balloon doesn’t mysteriously escape “gravity” while the rock is subjected to it, but rather, as was known for millennia before Newton’s silly theory, objects naturally rise/fall towards their own density. QR - How does the earth’s magnetic field work? Does the reverse side of the earth also have magnetism? The farthest anyone has ever drilled into the Earth is a mere 8 miles.  So in reality no one knows what is beyond 8 miles deep, but our scientific establishment has taken the liberty of providing every school textbook with images showing a ball-Earth with several hypothetical layers going from crust, to outer mantle, to inner mantle, to outer core and inner core where they claim there is hot molten magnetic metal causing Earth to have constantly moving magnetic dipoles on its surface!  In reality, they have not even drilled beyond the crust, but claim to know what exists at every layer and their theory of Earth’s magnetism resulting from a molten metal core suggests a type of magnet that doesn’t actually exist.  Our flat Earth’s actual magnetism however, works similar to that of a ring-magnet found in loud-speakers, where the North pole is the monopole pole at the center and the “South pole” is actually every point along the outer circumference. QR – There really is some compelling evidence that the Earth is flat and that we’ve all been deceived for centuries. In your opinion who is pulling the wool over our eyes and, more importantly, why? The Jews, Jesuits, Freemasons and other embedded secret societies in the current New World Order establishment have been lying about the Earth and many other subjects for centuries.

32,Paul Michael Bales - The Lying Morpheus,"There is a slanderous video going around of a jealous liar in a bathrobe making a number of baseless allegations against me which I'd like to address and put to rest.  To begin with, this man - , has been claiming to ""have awoken me to"" and ""taught me everything I know about the flat Earth"" for well over a year now in several videos.  In reality, however, I about flat Earth since 2009, whereas he admits to having only been a flat Earther since 2012, and posting about it since 2013.  The only interaction I've had with the guy was through a short Facebook correspondence while I was writing my book, , when he recommended some old flat Earth titles for me to check out.  Anyway, recently Mr. Bales has upped the ante and decided that, not only did he ""teach me everything I know about the flat Earth,"" but that I am also a CIA Agent, a Freemason, a Hollywood actor, a psychopath, a murderer, a wife-beater, a homosexual, a Nazi, a child-trafficker, a drug-smuggler and much more.  Surprisingly, there are many other such videos claiming similar things about me popping up nowadays and people constantly questioning me about them - so as ludicrous and unworthy of response as these accusations are, here are my answers: , in place to assure the quality of content and make sure the forum is not over-run by shills and trolls like (Flat Earth Society).  If you feel unduly banned by one of us, you can always try and appeal to us or just register a new account and continue posting.  If we continue to ban your new accounts, then it is safe to say we have deemed you a shill/troll and will not let you ruin our excellent forum with your non-sense.  But if you wish, you may still continue to try, and we will see who is more diligent, you at trying to co-opt and corrupt our forum, or us at maintaining its integrity. I have been writing about the Holohoax, Jewish bankers, and such subjects for years before writing my Flat Earth books, so when I first came out saying the Earth was flat, people said I was ""poisoning the holohoax well with flat Earth.""  Once flat Earth began making a stir and I uploaded my , however, people began saying I was ""poisoning the flat Earth well with the holohoax!""  To each accusation my response is the same - I am not poisoning any wells as the Flat Earth is absolutely true and the is absolutely false.  Adolf Hitler was nothing like the Jewish media portrays him, just like our flat, motionless Earth is nothing like the Jewish media portrays it. There are some websites that claim someone named ""Eric Dubay"" lived in Washington D.C. and this is being used as proof positive that I am a CIA agent.  Firstly, the two have no correlation whatsoever as there are hundreds of thousands of non CIA agents living in Washington D.C. at any given time.  Secondly, there is more than one Eric Dubay just from Maine, USA alone.  One of them is an avid golf player and has many google hits about his tournaments.  Thirdly, I have never lived in Washington D.C., regardless of what some random website claims.  I have no idea why there are websites claiming this, but regardless, I have never worked for the CIA nor have I ever lived in Washington D.C. The only known Freemason in my family is my great-uncle James Mays, who married into the family through my grandmother's sister.  He is not a Dubay, nor do we get along, and the only words we've spoken together since I've known he was a Mason and he's known about my books , when he called my book ""Bullshit"" then deleted his own comment and proceeded to block me on Facebook. People are now making compilations taking still shots of me from various videos and claiming I must be a Freemason because I am making the devil-horns or 666 hand-sign.  Firstly, I am NOT a Mason.  I am an ANTI-Mason and want Masonry exposed and abolished as is clearly evidenced by the body of work I've created over the past decade.  Secondly, I am a Yogi, and have exposed the ""hand-signs"" as being , which have only recently been perverted into Masonic gang-signs.  As a Yogi I do use some of these poses, like the gyani mudra in meditation every day.  Many of the other supposed signs I am making however are ridiculous or taken out of context.  For example they show me flashing the devil-horns during my routine, but forget to mention I was parodying Orphan Red, who herself was blatantly flashing the sign during her interview with Mark Sargent; or they show me in a common yoga asana and paint a compass/square over my arms and legs claiming it's a ""Masonic pose.""  Again, these are not Masonic in origin, nor am I a Mason. that merely lists 4 of my YouTube documentaries in it, and people are now claiming this as evidence that ""Eric Dubay is a Hollywood Actor!""  The truth is, however, I have never even visited California, let alone been in a Hollywood production, and just because someone put my YouTube videos into an IMDB database doesn't suddenly make me part of Hollywood. Pictures of a woman I was dating are circulating with claims that she is my wife or fiance and that since her parents work for the Thai military, that is proof positive that I am an NWO shill.  Firstly, I do not have a wife, fiance, or even girlfriend and the woman in question was merely someone I dated.  Her parents do work for the Thai army, but that has no bearing on me or my integrity, and I have expressed to them and their daughter my discontent for governments/militaries. As I have stated on many occasions now, I broke up with my previous Thai girlfriends due to their aggressive behavior towards me and NOT the other way around.  The woman showing a picture of a bruise on her thigh, claiming it as proof that I ""beat her,"" in fact abused me regularly throughout our relationship.  She had a poor childhood resulting in Borderline Personality Disorder which would often surface in tantrums where she did everything from slap, punch, kick, scratch and bite me; tantrums so violent that I would have to restrain her until she calmed down.  The reason we are no longer together is because I finally had enough of this and gave the ultimatum that if she ever got physical with me again I would break up, and she did, so I broke up with her. You Live in Thailand Where There Are Lots of Gays, Transsexuals, and Sex Trafficking, So You May Be Involved in That! does not make me a homosexual, tranny, sex-trafficker.  Thailand is a wonderful country with a lot more to offer the world than these lowest-common-denominator types would have you think.  Paul actually had the gall to suggest, with no evidence at all, that, ""Dubay may even be a part of the sex-trafficking and child-trafficking and that may be why he is in Thailand.""  If this isn't libelous slander, then I don't know what is. That's right Paul, I first had to complete my double Bachelors degree in Philosophy and English, then got my CELTA ESL teaching certificate, then got some experience at a private language school, then finally interviewed and I got a job teaching English at the largest and oldest University in Thailand.  That is merely a testament to my aptitude as an intelligent and diligent human being, NOT evidence for your jealous conspiracy theory. You Write Books, Hip-Hop Songs, Run a Wing Chun and Yoga Academy, Make Videos and Interviews, Where Do You Get the Time!? I have the same 24 hours in my day as you do Paul, I just don't spend them in my pajamas making slanderous hate videos about people I'm jealous of. ), buying up flat Earth URL keywords, creating over 50 terrible flat Earth websites with them, including a clone IFERS site where he himself claimed to be president of IFERS. The simple truth is the powers that be are gravely 
concerned of the flat Earth movement I have helped spark and maintain, 
and they are desperate to defame, denounce and discredit me in any way 
possible.  Since they have completely failed to debunk my evidence, they
 are now taking to personal attacks and trying to denounce my character 
so people will not see me as a leader.  To my readers, if you do see people making these slanderous false accusations about me, please link them to this article so they can hear my side of the story and figure out the truth for themselves.  Thank you!"
33,Flat Earth is the Most Important Truth,"Eric Dubay says the greatest lie and most successful cover-up in history, NASA and Freemasonry's biggest secret, is that we live on a plane, not a planet; that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe. Eric is an American living in Thailand where he teaches Yoga and Wing Chun part-time while exposing the New World Order full-time. He is the author of five books and is the president of the From Mel Fabregas: Let me begin this interview by stating that I have no attachment to the flat earth. I have no attachment to the oblate spheroid, and even to the sphere. If our home is any of these, so be it. I wouldn't be surprised of any. What I continue to be surprised and suspicious of are the people who continue attacking those who simply ask questions. I recently attended a conference that deals with the most open minded topics you could possibly imagine. However, when it comes to the flat earth topic, it was a no no. Look, I can't say I blame people for thinking this is the most absurd topic under the sun, or the firmament, rather, but you, open minded people who discuss aliens, UFOs, reptilians who rule the world, Bigfoot, and the rest of it, why do you continue telling people to stop looking into the flat earth? Those of you who study the pyramids and ancient civilizations, you venerate these ancient ones, and rightfully so, and some of these very ancient ones believed the earth was flat. Why do you then continue looking into their achievements if the notion of a flat earth is so absurd? Shouldn't that discredit them too? And those of you who continue writing to me saying the ancient ones knew they lived on a sphere, how did they know? Perhaps they had advanced technology that allowed seeing the skies above. Just because you see sphere above you doesn't prove you are standing on one. You can still play pool on a flat table and basketball on a flat court.  Perhaps the psyop is questioning those who question the true shape of our plane(t)."
34,Architects & Engineers for Flat Earth Truth,"Canals and railways, for example, are always
cut and laid horizontally, often over hundreds of miles, without any allowance
for curvature. The puzzle to me used to be, that over
several miles each level was and is treated throughout its whole length as the
same level from end to end; not the least allowance being made for
curvature. One of the civil engineers in
this district, after some amount of argument on each side as to the reason why
no allowance for curvature was made, said he did not believe anybody would know
the shape of the earth in this life Another Surveyor and Engineer of thirty years wrote to the
Birmingham Weekly Mercury, Feb. 15th, 1890 stating, “ However bigoted some of our professors may be
in the theory of surveying according to the prescribed rules, yet it is well
known amongst us that such theoretical measurements are INCAPABLE OF ANY
PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION. There are, of course, partial
inclines or gradients here and there, but they are always accurately defined
and must be carefully traversed. But
anything approaching to eight inches in the mile, increasing as the square of
the distance, COULD NOT BE WORKED BY ANY ENGINE THAT WAS EVER YET
CONSTRUCTED. Taking one station with
another all over England and Scotland, it may be stated that all the platforms
are ON THE SAME RELATIVE LEVEL. If the prescribed curvature was
indeed as represented, the central stations at Rugby or Warwick ought to be
close upon three miles higher than a chord drawn from the two extremities. If such was the case there is not a driver or
stoker within the Kingdom that would be found to take charge of the train. We can only laugh at those of your readers
who seriously give us credit for such venturesome exploits, as running trains
round spherical curves. Horizontal
curves on levels are dangerous enough, vertical curves would be a thousand
times worse, and with our rolling stock constructed as at present Engineer, W. Winckler, wrote into the Earth Review October 1893
regarding the Earth’s supposed curvature, stating, “ As an engineer of many
years standing, I saw that this absurd allowance is only permitted in school
books. I have
projected many miles of railways and many more of canals and the allowance has
not even been thought of, much less allowed for. This allowance for curvature means this -
that it is 8” for the first mile of a canal, and increasing at the ratio by the
square of the distance in miles; thus a small navigable canal for boats, say 30
miles long, will have, by the above rule an allowance for curvature of 600
feet. We no more think of allowing 600 feet for a line of 30 miles of railway
or canal, than of wasting our time trying to square the circle The Suez Canal which connects the Mediterranean Sea with the
Gulf of Suez on the Red Sea is a clear proof of the Earth’s and water’s
non-convexity. The canal is 100 miles
long and without any locks so the water within is an uninterrupted continuation
of the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea. When it was constructed, the Earth’s supposed curvature was not taken
into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level,
passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line
and the water’s surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. The average level of the Mediterranean is 6
inches above the Red Sea, while the floodtides in the Red Sea rise 4 feet above
the highest and drop 3 feet below the lowest in the Mediterranean, making the
half-tide level of the Red Sea, the surface of the Mediterranean Sea, and the
100 miles of water in the canal, all a clear continuation of the same
horizontal line! Were they instead the
supposed curved line of globe-Earthers, the water in the center of the canal
would be 1666 feet (50 The distance between the Red Sea at Suez and the
Mediterranean Sea is 100 statute miles, the datum line of the Canal being 26
feet below the level of the Mediterranean, and is continued horizontally the
whole way from sea to sea, there not being a single lock on the Canal, the
surface of the water being parallel with the datum line. It is thus clear that
there is no curvature or globularity for the whole hundred miles between the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea; had there been, according to the Astronomic
theory, the middle of the Canal would have been 1,666 feet higher than at
either end, whereas the Canal is perfectly horizontal for the whole distance.
The Great Canal of China, said to be 700 miles in length, was made without
regard to any allowance for supposed curvature, as the Chinese believe the
Earth to be a Stationary Plane. I may also add that no allowance was made for
it in the North Sea Canal, or in the Manchester Ship Canal, both recently
constructed, thus clearly proving that there is no globularity in Earth or Sea,
so that the world cannot possibly be a Planet. If the earth be the globe of popular belief, it is very
evident that in cutting a canal, an allowance must be made for the curvature of
the globe, which allowance would correspond to the square of the distance
multiplied by eight inches. ‘The German Emperor performed the ceremony of
opening the Gates of the Baltic and North Sea Canal, in the spring of
1891. The canal starts at Holtenau, on
the south side of Kiel Bay, and joins the Elbe 15 miles above its mouth. It is 61 miles long, 200 feet wide at the
surface and 85 feet at the bottom, the depth being 28 feet. Let those
who believe it is the practice for surveyors to make allowance for ‘curvature’
ponder over the following from the Manchester Ship Canal Company (Earth Review,
October, 1893) ‘It is customary in
Railway and Canal constructions for all levels to be referred to a datum which
is nominally horizontal and is so shown on all sections. The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles
long between London and Liverpool. If the world were actually a
globe, however, curveting 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of
rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising a full 5,400
feet above London and Liverpool. Adding
the station’s actual height (240 feet) to its theoretical inclination (5,400
feet) gives 5,640 feet as the rail’s necessary height on a globe-Earth, more
than a thousand feet taller than Ben Nevis, the tallest mountain in Great
Britain! In projecting railways on a globe, the datum line would
be the arc of a circle corresponding to the latitude of the place. That the datum line for the railway
projections is always a horizontal line, proves that the general configuration
of the world is horizontal. To support
the globe theory, the gentlemen of the observatories should call upon the
surveyor to prove that he allows the necessary amount for ‘curvature.’ But this is what the learned men dare not do,
as it is well-known that the allowance for the supposed curvature is never
made. In a long line, like that of the Great Pacific Railway,
extending across North America, the supposed curvature would, of course, be
proportionately great, extending to many miles in height, but not one inch was
allowed by the engineers for curvature during the whole course of the
construction of that vast line of Railway. And, if we think of it, how could it
be otherwise? All Railway metals must, of necessity, be straight, for how could
any engine or carriage run with safety on a convex surface? J.C. Bourne in his book, “The History of the Great Western Railway” stated
that the entire original English railroad, more than 118 miles long, that the
whole line with the exception of the inclined planes, may be regarded
practically as level. That the section be drawn to the same HORIZONTAL scale as the
plan, and to a vertical scale of not less than one inch to every one hundred
feet, and shall show the surface of the ground marked on the plan, the intended
level of the proposed work, the height of every embankment, and the depth of
every cutting, and a DATUM HORIZONTAL LINE which shall be the same throughout
the whole length of the work. One hundred and eighteen miles of LEVEL railway, and yet
the surface on which it is projected a globe? This
gentleman told me he had projected thousands of miles of level railway in South
America, and never heard of any allowance for curvature being made. On one occasion he surveyed over one thousand
miles of railway which was a perfect straight line all the way. It is well known that in the Argentine
Republic and other parts of South America, there are railways thousands of
miles long without curve or gradient. In
projecting railways, the world is acknowledged to be a plane, and if it were a
globe the rules of projection have yet to be discovered. Level railways prove a level world, to the
utter confusion of the globular school of impractical men with high salaries
and little brains That in all surveys no allowance is made for curvature, which
would be a necessity on a globe; that a horizontal line is in every case the
datum line, the same line being continuous throughout the whole length of the
work; and that the theodolite cuts a line at equal altitudes on either side of
it, which altitude is the same as that of the instrument, clearly proves, to
those who will accept proof when it is furnished, that the world is a plane and
not a globe"
35,Arctic Midnight Sun Proves Flat Earth,"During Arctic summer, from the 22nd to the 25th of June, at
a high enough latitude and altitude, you can watch a phenomenon known as “the
Midnight Sun” where the Sun stays continuously visible in the sky for 3 days
straight! The “Midnight Sun” rises on
the 22nd and for the next 72 hours never disappears from sight, slowly
ascending and descending every 12 hours, showing 3 brilliant “sunsets” and
“sunrises” without ever actually setting below the horizon. In “The Brighton Examiner” of July, 1870,
United States Ambassador to Norway, Mr. Campbell, described his experience witnessing
the Midnight Sun with a group of gentlemen, on a cliff 1000 feet above the
Arctic Sea at the 69th North parallel: It was late but still sunlight. The Arctic Ocean
stretched away in silent vastness at our feet, the sound of the waves scarcely
reached our airy look-out. Away in the north the huge old Sun swung low along
the horizon, like the slow beat of the tall clock in our grandfather's parlour
corner. We all stood silently looking at our watches. When both hands stood
together at twelve midnight, the full round orb hung triumphantly above the
waves—a bridge of gold running due north spangled the water between us and him.
There he shone in silent majesty which knew no setting. We involuntarily took
off our hats—no word was said. Combine the most brilliant sunrise you ever saw,
and its beauties will pall before the gorgeous colouring which lit up the
ocean, heaven, and mountains. In half an hour the Sun had swung up perceptibly
on its beat, the colours had changed to those of morning. A fresh breeze had
rippled over the florid sea; one songster after another piped out of the grove
behind us—we had slid into another day Tourists from Haparanda prefer going to Avasaxa, a hill 680 feet
above the sea, from which though eight or ten miles south of the arctic circle,
they can see the midnight sun for three days. As the voyage drew to a close, and we approached the upper end of the
Gulf of Bothnia the twilight had disappeared, and between the setting and
rising of the sun hardly one hour elapsed. It is 1
degree 18 minutes farther north than Archangel, and in the same latitude as the
most northern part of Iceland. From the 22nd to the 25th of June the
traveler may enjoy the sight of the midnight sun from Avasaxa, a hill six
hundred and eighty feet high, and about forty-five miles distant If the Earth were actually a spinning globe revolving around
the Sun, the only place such a phenomenon as the Midnight Sun could be observed
would be at the poles. Any other vantage
point from 89 degrees latitude downwards could never, regardless of any tilt or
inclination, see the Sun for 24 hours straight. To see the Sun for an entire revolution on a spinning globe at a point
other than the poles, you would have to be looking through miles and miles of
land and sea for part of the revolution! Anyone below the 89th parallel could never witness the Sun for 72 hours,
3 whole revolutions, straight because to do so would be to assume you are
somehow seeing “through the globe” and to the Sun on the other side! Since such an assumption is ridiculous, and
yet the Midnight Sun can clearly be seen as low as the 65 parallel, this is
another absolute proof that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the
universe. If the earth be a globe, at midnight the eye would have to
penetrate thousands of miles of land and water even at 65 degrees North
latitude, in order to see the sun at midnight. That the sun can be seen for days together in the Far North during the
Northern summer, proves that there is something very seriously wrong with the
globular hypothesis. Cook penetrated as far South as
71 degrees, Weddell in 1893 reached as far as 74 degrees, and Sir James C. Ross
in 1841 and 1842 reached the 78th parallel, but I am not aware that any of
these navigators have left it on record that the sun was seen at midnight in
the south. Heliocentrists also cannot explain why the Midnight Sun
phenomenon is not experienced anywhere in the Southern hemisphere at any time
of year. Quite to the contrary, it has
been recorded by the Royal Belgian Geographical Society in “Expedition
Antarctique Belge,” that during the most severe part of the Antarctic winter, from
71 degrees South latitude onwards, the sun sets on May 17th and is not seen
above the horizon again until July 21st! The Midnight Sun is seen from high altitudes
in extreme Northern latitudes during Arctic summer because the Sun, at its
inner-most cycle, is circling tightly enough around the polar center that it
remains visible above the horizon for someone at such a vantage point. Likewise, in extreme Southern latitudes
during Arctic summer, the Sun completely disappears from view for over 2 months
because there at the Northern Tropic, at the inner-most arc of its boomerang
journey, the Sun is circling the Northern center too tightly to be seen from
the Southern circumference. It is evident that in the great encircling oceans of the
south, and the numerous islands and parts of continents, which exist beyond
that part of the earth where the sun is vertical, cannot have their days and
nights, seasons, etc., precisely like those in the northern region. The north
is a centre, and the south is that centre radiated or thrown out to a vast oceanic
circumference, terminating in circular walls of ice, which form an impenetrable
frozen barrier. Hence the phenomena referred to as existing in the north must
be considerably modified in the south, For instance, the north being central,
the light of the sun advancing and receding, gives long periods of alternate
light and darkness at the actual centre; but in the far south, the sun, even
when moving in his outer path, can only throw its light to a certain distance,
beyond which there must be perpetual darkness. No evidence exists of there
being long periods of light and darkness regularly alternating, as in the
north. In the north, in summer-time, when the sun is moving in its inner path,
the light shines continually for months together over the central region, and
rapidly develops numerous forms of animal and vegetable life In typical reverse-engineered damage-control fashion, trying to
explain away the Midnight Sun, problematic Arctic/Antarctic phenomena, and the
fact that Polaris can be seen approximately 23.5 degrees South of the equator, desperate
heliocentrists in the late 19th century again modified their theory to say the
ball-Earth actually tilts back 23.5 degrees on its vertical axis, thus
explaining away many problems in one swoop! If it simply tilted the same direction constantly, however, this would
still not explain the phenomena because after 6 months of supposed orbital
motion around the Sun, any amount of tilt would be perfectly opposite, thus
negating their alleged explanation for Arctic/Antarctic irregularities. To account for this, heliocentrists added
that the Earth also “wobbles,” in a complex combination of patterns known as, “planetary
nutation,” the “Chandler wobble,” and “axial precession” which, in their vivid
imaginations, somehow explains away common sense. Common sense, however, says that if the heat of the Sun travels
93,000,000 miles to reach us, a small axial tilt and wobble, the difference of
a few thousand miles, should be completely negligible. If the ball-Earth actually spun around
93,000,000 miles from the Sun, regardless of any tilt or wobble, temperature and
climate the whole world over should be almost completely uniform. If the heat of the Sun truly travelled
ninety-three million miles to reach Earth’s equator, the extra few thousand
miles to the poles, regardless of any supposed “tilt” or “wobble,” no matter
how extreme, would surely be negligible in negating such intense heat! The supposition that the seasons are caused by the Earth’s annual
motion round the Sun at a mean distance of 92,500,000 of miles, is grotesque.
According to Piazzi the size of the Sun is in proportion to the Earth, as
329,360 to 1, the diameter exceeds that of the Earth 112 times. The Earth
appears, as Biot says, by this statement, ‘a mere grain of sand, as compared to
the Sun.’ This enormous expanse of light focused on a rotating ‘grain of sand,’
at the distance of 93 millions of miles, would cause the same season throughout
it. The paltry few miles, in comparison that separates London from Cape Town
could never cause diverse seasons, neither would the distance from London to
the Riviera justify the difference in the climate that characterizes the two
places Common sense also says if the Earth were actually a ball
spinning daily with uniform speed around the Sun, there should be exactly 12
hour days and 12 hour nights everywhere all year round regardless of any
alleged tilt or inclination, half the sphere would always be lit, the other
half not! The great variety in length of
days and nights throughout the year all over Earth testifies to the fact that we
do not live on a spinning ball-planet. There cannot exist phenomena such as this on a globe, nor the Midnight
Sun, nor anything like Antarctic winter where the Sun is nowhere to be found
for over 2 months per year! The theory of the rotation of the earth may once and for
all be definitely disposed of as impracticable by pointing out the following
inadvertence. It is said that the rotation takes twenty-four hours and that its
speed is uniform, in which case, necessarily, days and nights should have an
identical duration of twelve hours each all the year round. The sun should
invariably rise in the morning and set in the evening at the same hours, with
the result that it would be the equinox every day from the 1st of January to
the 31st of December. One should stop and reflect on this before saying that
the earth has a movement of rotation. How does the system of gravitation
account for the seasonal variations in the lengths of days and nights if the
earth rotates at a uniform speed in twenty-four hours!?"
36,Polaris Proves the Flat Earth,"NASA and modern astronomy say the Earth is a giant globe
spinning 1,000 mph around its central axis, traveling 67,000 mph circles around
the Sun, spiraling 500,000 mph around the Milky Way, while the entire galaxy
rockets a ridiculous 670,000,000 mph through the Universe, with all of these
motions originating from an alleged “Big Bang” cosmogenic explosion 14 billion
years ago. That’s a grand total of 670,568,000
mph in several different directions we’re all supposedly speeding along at
simultaneously. No one has ever seen,
felt, heard, measured or proven such motion, yet the vast majority of people unquestioningly
accept that the clearly motionless Earth beneath their feet is actually moving
over six hundred million miles per hour! NASA and modern astronomy say Polaris, the North Pole star,
is somewhere between 323-434 light years, or about 2 quadrillion miles, away
from us! Firstly, note that is between 1,938,000,000,000,000
- 2,604,000,000,000,000 miles making a difference of 666,000,000,000,000 (over
six hundred trillion) miles! However, even granting
them their obscurely distant stars, heliocentric astronomers cannot adequately
explain how Polaris manages to always remain almost perfectly aligned straight
above the North Pole. If the globe-Earth was really spinning West-East 1,000 mph, orbiting
the Sun counter-clockwise at 67,000 mph, spiraling around the outer-arms of the
Milky Way at 500,000 mph, while shooting through the Universe at 670,000,000
mph, how is it even conceptually possible that Polaris, 2 quadrillion miles
away, day after day, year after year, always maintains its alignment straight
above the North Pole!? That would mean
from 2 quadrillion miles away, Polaris would have to be perfectly mirroring
Earth’s several simultaneous wobbling, spinning, spiraling, and shooting
motions. Polaris would have to be
shooting the same direction through the Universe at exactly 670,000,000 mph; it
would have to be following the same 500,000 mph, 225 million year spiral around
the Milky Way, and mirroring the same 67,000 mph, 365 day orbit around our Sun! It is supposed in the regular course of the Newtonian
theory that the Earth is, in June, about 190 millions of miles (190,000,000)
away from its position in December. Now, since we can, (in middle north
latitudes) see the North Star, on looking out of a window that faces it - and
out of the very same corner of the very same pane of glass in the very same
window - all the year round, it is proof enough for any man in his senses that
we have made no motion at all. Not only this, but viewed from a ball-Earth, Polaris, situated almost
straight over the North Pole, should not be visible anywhere in the Southern
Hemisphere. For Polaris to be seen from
the Southern Hemisphere of a globular Earth, the observer would have to be
somehow looking “through the globe,” and miles of land and sea would have to be
transparent. If the Earth is a sphere and the pole star hangs over
the northern axis, it would be impossible to see it for a single degree beyond
the equator, or 90 degrees from the pole. The line-of-sight would become a tangent to the sphere, and consequently
several thousand miles out of and divergent from the direction of the pole
star. Many cases, however, are on record
of the north polar star being visible far beyond the equator, as far even as
the tropic of Capricorn The astronomers' theory of a globular Earth necessitates
the conclusion that, if we travel south of the equator, to see the North Star
is an impossibility. Yet it is well known this star has been seen by navigators
when they have been more than 20 degrees south of the equator. This fact, like
hundreds of other facts, puts the theory to shame, and gives us a proof that
the Earth is not a globe To account for this glaring problem in their model,
desperate heliocentrists since the late 19th century have claimed the
ball-Earth actually tilts a convenient 23.5 degrees back on its vertical axis. Even this brilliant revision to their theory
cannot account for the visibility of many other constellations though. For instance, Ursa Major, very close to
Polaris, can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude (the North Pole) all the
way down to 30 degrees South latitude. The constellation Vulpecula can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude,
all the way to 55 degrees South latitude. The constellation Virgo is visible from 80
degrees North down to 80 degrees South, and Orion can be seen from 85 degrees
North all the way to 75 degrees South latitude! An observer on a ball-Earth, regardless of any tilt or inclination,
should not logically be able to see this far. Another thing is certain, that from within the equator
the north pole star, and the constellations Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and many
others, can be seen from every meridian simultaneously; whereas in the south,
from the equator, neither the so-called south pole star, nor the remarkable
constellation of the Southern Cross, can be seen simultaneously from every
meridian, showing that all the constellations of the south - pole star included
- sweep over a great southern arc and across the meridian, from their rise in
the evening to their setting in the morning. But if the earth is a globe, Sigma Octantis, a south pole star, and the
Southern Cross, a southern circumpolar constellation, they would all be visible
at the same time from every longitude on the same latitude, as is the case with
the northern pole star and the northern circumpolar constellations. Some heliocentrists have even tried to suggest that the Pole
Star’s gradual declination overhead as an observer travels southwards is proof
of a globular Earth. Far from it, the
declination of the Pole Star or any other object is simply a result of the Law
of Perspective. The Law of Perspective
dictates that the angle and height at which an object is seen diminishes the
farther one recedes from the object, until at a certain point the line of sight
and the seemingly uprising surface of the Earth converges to a vanishing point
(i.e. the horizon line) beyond which the object is invisible. If we select a flat street a mile long, containing a row of
lamps, it will be noticed that from where we stand the lamps gradually decline
to the ground, the last one being apparently quite on the ground. Take the lamp at the end of the street and
walk away from it a hundred yards, and it will appear to be much nearer the
ground than when we were close to it; keep on walking away from it and it will
appear to be gradually depressed until it is last seen on the ground and then
disappears. Now, according to the
astronomers, the whole mile was only depressed about eight inches from one end
to the other, so that this 8 in. could not account for the enormous depression
of the light as we recede from it. This
proves that the depression of the Pole Star can and does take place in relation
to a flat surface, simply because we increase our distance from it, the same as
from the street lamp. In other words,
the further away we get from any object above us, as a star for example, the
more it is depressed, and if we go far enough it will sink (or appear to sink)
to the horizon and then disappear. It has often been urged that the earth must be a globe,
because the stars in the southern ‘hemisphere’ move round a south polar star;
in the same way that those of the north revolve round the northern pole star.
This is another instance of the sacrifice of truth, and denial of the evidence
of our senses for the purpose of supporting a theory which is in every sense
false and unnatural. It is known to every observer that the north pole star is
the centre of a number of constellations which move over the earth in a
circular direction. Those nearest to it, as the ‘Great Bear,’ etc. are always
visible in England during their whole twenty-four hours' revolution. Those
further away southwards rise north-north-east, and set south-south-west; still
further south they rise east by north, and set west by north. The farthest
south visible from England, the rising is more to the east and south-east, and
the setting to the west and south-west. But all the stars visible from London
rise and set in a way which is not compatible with the doctrine of rotundity. For
instance, if we stand with our backs to the north, on the high land known as ‘Arthur's
Seat,’ near Edinburgh, and note the stars in the zenith of our position, and
watch for several hours, the zenith stars will gradually recede to the
north-west. If we do the same on Woodhouse Moor, near Leeds, or on any of the
mountain tops in Yorkshire or Derbyshire, the same phenomenon is observed. The
same thing may be seen from the top of Primrose Hill, near Regent's Park,
London; from Hampstead Heath; or Shooter's Hill, near Woolwich. If we remain
all night, we shall observe the same stars rising towards our position from the
north-east, showing that the path of all the stars between ourselves and the
northern centre move round the north pole-star as a common centre of rotation;
just as they must do over a plane such as the earth is proved to be. It is
undeniable that upon a globe zenith stars would rise, pass over head, and set
in the plane of the observer's position. If now we carefully watch in the
same way the zenith stars from the Rock of Gibraltar, the very same phenomenon
is observed. The same is also the case from Cape of Good Hope, Sydney and
Melbourne in Australia, in New Zealand, in Rio Janeiro, Monte Video,
Valparaiso, and other places in the south. If then the zenith stars of all
the places on the earth, where special observations have been made, rise from
the morning horizon to the zenith of an observer, and descend to the evening
horizon, not in a plane of the position of such observer, but in an arc
of a circle concentric with the northern centre, the earth is thereby proved to
be a plane, and rotundity altogether disproved - shown, indeed, to be
impossible"
37,The Always Horizontal Horizon Proves Earth Flat,"Whether at sea-level, the top of Mount Everest, or flying over a hundred thousand feet in the air, the always horizontal horizon line always rises up to
meet the eye-level of the observer and remains perfectly flat. You can test for yourself on a beach or
hilltop, in a large field or desert, aboard a hot-air balloon or helicopter; you
will see the panoramic horizon ascend with you and remain completely level all
around. If the Earth were actually a big
ball, however, the horizon should sink as you ascend, not rise to your eye-level,
and it would dip at each end of your periphery, not remain flat all
around. Standing in a rising balloon, you
would have to look downwards to the horizon; the highest point of the ball-Earth
would be directly beneath you and declining on each side. In an editorial from the London Journal, July 18, 1857, one
journalist described quite the opposite in his hot-air balloon ascent, “ The
chief peculiarity of the view from a balloon at a considerable elevation was
the altitude of the horizon, which remained practically on a level with the eye
at an elevation of two miles, causing the surface of the earth to appear
concave instead of convex, and to recede during the rapid ascent, whilst the
horizon and the balloon seemed to be stationary. On looking over the top of the car, the horizon appeared to be
on a level with the eye, and taking a grand view of the whole visible area
beneath, I was struck with its great regularity; all was dwarfed to one plane;
it seemed too flat. Instead of the earth
declining from the view on either side, and the higher part being under the
car, as is popularly supposed, it was the exact opposite; the lowest part, like
a huge basin, being immediately under the car, and the horizon on all sides
rising to the level of the eye. Philosophy forces the truth upon us; but the
view of the earth from the elevation of a balloon is that of an immense
terrestrial basin, the deeper part of which is directly under one’s feet. Another curious effect of the aerial ascent was,
that the Earth, when we were at our greatest altitude, positively appeared
concave, looking like a huge dark bowl, rather than the convex sphere such as
we naturally expect to see it. The
horizon always appears to be on a level with our eye, and seems to rise as we
rise, until at length the elevation of the circular boundary line of the sight
becomes so marked that the Earth assumes the anomalous appearance as we have
said of a concave rather than a convex body Amateurs have sent balloons to heights of over 121,000 feet
and you can watch video online of the horizon rising with the camera-level and
remaining perfectly flat 360 degrees around. NASA videos and other “official” sources, however, such as the recent
Red Bull skydive at 128,000 feet have been Panoramic photos atop Mount Everest also often
claim to be displaying Earth’s curvature, but this is simply the result of
distortions and limitations inherent in wide-angle lenses. I have exposed the full extent of NASA’s camera trickery and
doctored CGI sphere Earth pictures/videos The camera distorted horizons have always been a misleading
factor with those who have not freed their minds from the ‘planet’ or ‘globe
earth indoctrination.’ Three or four
years ago, the U.S.I.S. booklet ‘Science Horizons,’ carried a note to the
effect that the Americans hoped to produce a lens which would NOT distort level
horizons. Flat Earthists however can prove that due to
the known laws of perspective, the horizon, optically rises and remains level
with the observer’s, or the camera’s eye, no matter what height is
achieved. In fact the earth immediately
beneath balloon, airplane, rocket or capsule, presents a dish-shaped or concave
appearance. It is NOT the highest point of your ‘globe’ earth with the dip or
curvature of the ‘ball’ sweeping away downwards to a horizon far away below the
eye level. If the Earth were actually a big ball 25,000 miles in
circumference, the horizon would be noticeably curved ( ), and
everything on or approaching the horizon would appear to tilt backwards
slightly from your perspective. Distant
buildings along the horizon would all look like leaning towers of Piza falling
away from the observer. hot-air balloon taking off then drifting
steadily away from you, on a ball-Earth would slowly and constantly appear to lean
back more and more the farther away it flew, the bottom of the basket coming
gradually into view as the top of the balloon disappears from sight. In reality, however, buildings, balloons,
trees, people, anything and everything at right angles to the ground/horizon
remains so regardless the distance of the observer. The marine horizon, from whatever position it is viewed,
always appears to be, and is, in fact, a perfectly level line, and since this
appearance is the same in all parts of the world, its surface must be level;
and therefore the Earth is a Plane. This
may be proved to be the case, by erecting at a suitable elevation on the sea
shore, a duly-levelled board, or a string - at right angles to a plumb-line -
tightly stretched between two vertical poles. On looking towards the sea, the horizontal line for a distance of 20
miles may be easily observed, and throughout its entire length it will be found
to coincide with the straight-edge, or string: but if the earth were a globe,
the horizontal line would form an arc of twenty miles in length, curveting both
ways from the center, at the rate of eight inches, multiplied by the square of
the distance. Hence the horizontal line
at either end of the distance ought to be depressed some 66 feet below the
horizon in the center. But as no such
appearance is ever presented, it necessarily follows that the earth cannot be a
globe, or other than a plane Anyone can prove the sea-horizon perfectly straight and the
entire Earth perfectly flat using nothing more than a level, tripods and a
wooden plank. At any altitude above
sea-level, simply fix a 6-12 foot long, smooth, leveled board edgewise upon
tripods and observe the skyline from eye-level behind it. Furthermore, if you move in a half-circle
from one end of the board to the other whilst observing the skyline over the
upper edge, you will be able to trace a clear, flat 10-20 miles depending on
your altitude. If the Earth were actually a globe 25,000
miles in circumference, the horizon would align over the center of the board
but then gradually, noticeably decline towards the extremities. It is known that the horizon at sea, whatever distance
it may extend to the right and left of the observer on land, always appears as
a straight line. At Brighton, on a rising ground near the race
course, two poles were fixed in the earth six yards apart, and directly
opposite the sea. From the center of the line the view embraced
not less than 20 miles on each side making a distance of 40 miles. A vessel was observed sailing directly
westwards; the line cut the rigging a little above the bulwarks, which it did
for several hours or until the vessel had sailed the whole distance of 40
miles. The ship coming into view from
the east would have to ascend an inclined plane for 20 miles until it arrived
at the center of the arc, whence it would have to descend for the same
distance. The square of 20 miles
multiplied by 8 inches gives 266 feet as the amount the vessel would be below
the line at the beginning and at the end of the 40 miles. From the highland near Portsmouth Harbor in Hampshire,
England looking across Spithead to the Isle of Wight, the entire base of the
island, where water and land come together composes a perfectly straight line
22 statute miles long. According to the
ball-Earth theory, the Isle of Wight should decline 80 feet from the center on
each side to account for the necessary curvature. The cross-hairs of a good theodolite directed
there, however, have repeatedly shown the land and water line to be perfectly
level. On a clear day from the highland near Douglas Harbor on the
Isle of Man, the whole length of the coast of North Wales is often plainly
visible to the naked eye. From the Point
of Ayr at the mouth of the River Dee to Holyhead comprises a 50 mile stretch
which has also been repeatedly found to be perfectly horizontal. , as NASA and modern astronomy claim, the 50 mile length
of Welsh coast seen along the horizon in Liverpool Bay would have to decline
from the center-point an easily detectable 416 feet on each side! But as such declination, or downward curvation, cannot be
detected, the conclusion is logically inevitable that it has no existence. Let
the reader seriously ask whether any and what reason exists in Nature to
prevent the fall of more than 400 feet being visible to the eye, or incapable
of detection by any optical or mathematical means whatever. This question is
especially important when it is considered that at the same distance, and on
the upper outline of the same land, changes of level of only a few yards extent
are quickly and unmistakably perceptible. If a man is guided by evidence and reason, and influenced by a love of
truth and consistency, he cannot longer maintain that the earth is a globe. He
must feel that to do so is to war with the evidence of his senses, to deny that
any importance attaches to fact and experiment, to ignore entirely the value of
logical process, and to cease to rely upon practical induction"
38,The Natural Physics of Water Prove Earth Flat,"It is part of the natural physics of water and other fluids
to always find their level and remain flat. If dammed up then released, the
nature of all liquids is to quickly flood outwards taking the easiest course towards
finding its new level. Because if a part of the surface
were higher than the rest, those parts of the fluid which were under it would
exert a greater pressure upon the surrounding parts than they receive from
them, so that motion would take place amongst the particles and continue until
there were none at a higher level than the rest, that is, until the upper
surface of the whole mass of fluid became a horizontal plane If the Earth is an extended flat plane, then this
fundamental physical property of fluids finding and remaining level is
consistent with experience and common sense. If, however, the Earth is a giant sphere tilted on its vertical axis spinning
through never-ending space then it follows that truly flat, consistently level
surfaces do not exist here! Moreover, if
the Earth is spherical then it follows that the surface of all Earth’s water, including
the massive oceans, must maintain a certain degree of convexity. The surface of all water, when not agitated by natural
causes, such as winds, tides, earthquakes etc. is perfectly level. Can
any so-called scientist, who teaches that the earth is a whirling globe, take a
heap of liquid water, whirl it round, and so make rotundity? Therefore it is utterly impossible to prove that an ocean is a whirling
rotund section of a globular earth, rushing through ‘space’ at the
lying-given-rate of false philosophers. If we were living on a whirling ball-Earth, every pond,
lake, marsh, canal and other large body of standing water, each part would have
to comprise a slight arc or semi-circle curveting downwards from the central
summit. For example, if the ball-Earth
were 25,000 miles in circumference as NASA and modern astronomers say, then
spherical trigonometry dictates the surface of all standing water must curve
downwards an easily measureable 8 inches per mile multiplied by the square of
the distance. This means along a 6 mile
channel of standing water the Earth would dip 6 feet on either end from the
central peak. To the benefit of true
science, and to the detriment of modern astronomy’s pseudo-science, such an
experiment can and has been tested. In Cambridge, England there is a 20 mile canal called the
Old Bedford which passes in a straight line through the Fenlands known as the
Bedford Level. The water has no
interruption from locks or water-gates of any kind and remains stationary
making it perfectly suitable for determining whether any amount of
convexity/curvature actually exists. In
the latter part of the 19th century, Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, a famous
Flat-Earther and author of the fine book, “ Earth Not a Globe!  An Experimental Inquiry into the True Figure of the Earth: Proving it a Plane, Without Axial or Orbital Motion; and the Only Material World in the Universe! ” travelled to the Bedford level and performed a
series of experiments to determine whether the surface of standing water is
flat or convex. A boat, with a flag-staff, the top of the flag 5 feet
above the surface of the water, was directed to sail from a place called
‘Welche's Dam’ (a well-known ferry passage), to another called ‘Welney Bridge.’
These two points are six statute miles apart. The author, with a good
telescope, went into the water; and with the eye about 8 inches above the
surface, observed the receding boat during the whole period required to sail to
Welney Bridge. The flag and the boat were distinctly visible throughout the
whole distance! There could be no mistake as to the distance passed over, as
the man in charge of the boat had instructions to lift one of his oars to the
top of the arch the moment he reached the bridge. The experiment commenced
about three o'clock in the afternoon of a summer's day, and the sun was shining
brightly and nearly behind or against the boat during the whole of its passage.
Every necessary condition had been fulfilled, and the result was to the last degree
definite and satisfactory. The conclusion was unavoidable that the surface of
the water for a length of six miles did not to any appreciable extent decline
or curvate downwards from the line of sight. But if the earth is a
globe, the surface of the six miles length of water would have been 6 feet
higher in the centre than at the two extremities. From this experiment it follows that the
surface of standing water is not convex, and therefore that the Earth is not a
globe! On the contrary, this
simple experiment is all-sufficient to prove that the surface of the water is
parallel to the line-of-sight, and is therefore horizontal, and that the Earth
cannot be other than a plane! An Experimental Inquiry into the True Figure
of the Earth: Proving it a Plane, Without Axial or Orbital Motion; and the Only
Material World in The Universe!” (12-13) In a second experiment, Dr. Rowbotham placed seven flags along the
edge of the water each one mile distant from the next with their tops
positioned 5 feet above the surface. Near the last one he also positioned a longer, 8 foot staff bearing a 3
foot flag so that its bottom aligned precisely with the tops of the other
flags. If the Earth was a globe of 25,000 miles,
each successive flag would have to decline a definite and determined amount
below the last. The first and second
flags simply established the line of sight, the third flag should then fall 8
inches below the second, the fourth flag 32 inches below, the fifth 6 feet, the
sixth 10 feet 8 inches, and the seventh flag should be a clear 16 feet 8 inches
below the line of sight! Even if the
Earth was a globe of a hundred thousand miles, an amount of easily measurable
curvature should and would still be evident in this experiment. But the reality is not a single inch of
curvature was detected and the flags all lined up perfectly as consistent with
a flat plane. The rotundity of the earth would necessitate the above
conditions; but as they cannot be found to exist, the doctrine must be
pronounced as only a simple theory, having no foundation in fact--a pure
invention of misdirected genius; splendid in its comprehensiveness and bearing
upon natural phenomena; but, nevertheless, mathematical and logical necessities
compel its denunciation as an absolute falsehood. Dr. Rowbotham conducted several other experiments using telescopes,
spirit levels, and “theodolites,” special precision instruments used for
measuring angles in horizontal or vertical planes. By positioning them at equal heights aimed at
each other successively he proved over and over the Earth to be perfectly flat
for miles without a single inch of curvature. His findings caused quite a stir in the scientific community and thanks
to 30 years of his efforts, the shape of the Earth became a hot topic of debate
around the turn of the nineteenth century. Is water level, or is it not?’ was a question once asked of an
astronomer. ‘Practically, yes; theoretically, no,’ was the reply. Now, when theory does not harmonize with
practice, the best thing to do is to drop the theory. (It is getting too late,
now to say ‘So much the worse for the facts!’) To drop the theory which
supposes a curved surface to standing water is to acknowledge the facts. Whenever experiments have been tried on the
surface of standing water, the surface has always been found to be level. If
the Earth were a globe, the surface of all standing water would be convex. This
is an experimental proof that Earth is not a globe Since any given body of water must have a level surface,
no one part higher than another, and seeing that all our oceans (a few inland
seas excepted) are connected together, it follows that they are all VIRTUALLY
OF THE SAME LEVEL. Astronomers say the magical magnetism of gravity is what keeps
all the oceans of the world stuck to the ball-Earth. They say that because the Earth is so
massive, by virtue of this mass it creates a magic force able to hold people,
oceans and atmosphere tightly clung to the underside of the spinning ball. Unfortunately, however, they cannot provide
any practical example of this on a scale smaller than the planetary. For example, a spinning wet tennis ball has
the exact opposite effect of the supposed ball-Earth! Any water poured over it
simply falls off the sides, and giving it a spin results in water flying off
360 degrees like a dog shaking after a bath. Astronomers concede the wet tennis ball example displays the opposite
effect of their supposed ball-Earth, but claim that at some unknown mass, the magic
adhesive properties of gravity suddenly kick in allowing the spinning wet
tennis ball-Earth to keep every drop of “gravitized” water stuck to the
surface. Again, their theory flies in
the face of all practical evidence, but they have been running with it for 500
years, so why stop now? If the Earth were a globe, rolling and dashing through ‘space’ at
the rate of ‘a hundred miles in five seconds of time,’ the waters of seas and
oceans could not, by any known law, be kept on its surface - the assertion that
they could be retained under these circumstances being an outrage upon human
understanding and credulity! But as the Earth - that is, the habitable world of
dry land - is found to be ‘standing out of the water and in the water’ of the
‘mighty deep,’ whose circumferential boundary is ice, we may throw the
statement back into the teeth of those who make it and flaunt before their
faces the flag of reason and common sense, inscribed with a proof that the
Earth is not a globe. In one portion of its long route, the great river Nile flows
for a thousand miles with a fall of only one foot! This is a feat which, of course, would be a
sheer impossibility if the Earth had spherical curvature. Many other rivers including the Congo in West
Africa, the Amazon in South America, and the Mississippi in North America all
flow for thousands of miles in directions totally incompatible with the
supposed globularity of the Earth as well. Rising at an altitude above
sea-level, in some cases thousands of feet above the sea, they follow the
easiest route to their level - the sea. The ‘Parana’ and ‘Paraguay’ in South America are navigable for over
2,000 miles, and their waters run the same way until they find their level of
stability, where the sea tides begin. But if the world be a globe, the ‘Amazon’ in South America that flows
always in an easterly direction, would sometimes be running uphill and
sometimes down, according to the movement of the globe. Then the ‘Congo’ in West Africa, that always
pursues a westerly course to the sea, would in the same manner be running
alternately up and down. When that point
of the globe exactly between them was up, they would both be running up,
although in opposite directions; and when the globe took half a turn, they
would both be running down! We know from
practical experiment that water will find its level, and cannot by any
possibility remain other than level, or flat, or horizontal - whatever term may
be used to express the idea. It is
therefore quite out of the range of possibility that rivers could do as they
would have to do on a globe Whoever heard of a river in any part of its course flowing
uphill? Yet this it would require to do were the Earth a Globe. Rivers, like
the Mississippi, which flow from the North southwards towards the Equator,
would need, according to Modem Astronomic theory, to run upwards, as the Earth
at the Equator is said to bulge out considerably more, or, in other words, is
higher than at any other part. Thus the Mississippi, in its immense course of
over 3,000 miles, would have to ascend 11 miles before it reached the Gulf of
Mexico! There are rivers which flow east, west, north, and south
- that is, rivers are flowing in all directions over the Earth's surface, and
at the same time. Now, if the Earth were a globe, some of these rivers would be
flowing up-hill and others down, taking it for a fact that there really is an
‘up’ and a ‘down’ in nature, whatever form she assumes. But, since rivers do
not flow up-hill, and the globular theory requires that they should, it is a
proof that the Earth is not a globe"
39,Earth is the Center of the Universe!,"Ancient civilizations the world over believed Earth to be
the flat, immovable center of the universe around which the heavens revolved daily
cycles in perfect circles. , proven true by experience and experiments, which reigned undisputed for
thousands of years adequately explaining all Earthly and celestial phenomena, was
violently uprooted, spun around, and sent flying through infinite space by a
cabal of Sun-worshipping theoretical astronomers. Early Masonic magicians like Copernicus,
Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, along with their modern Masonic astro-not
counter-parts like Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins, hand-in-hand with have pulled off the greatest hoax, propagated the most
phenomenal lie, and perpetuated the most complete indoctrination in history. Over the course of 500 years, using everything from books, magazines,
and television to computer-generated imaging, a multi-generational conspiracy
has succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick up the fixed Earth, shape it
into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! In schools where every professor’s desk is adorned
with a spinning Earth-globe, we are lectured on the “heliocentric” theory of
the universe, shown images of ball-planets and videos of men suspended in space. The illusion created, connivingly convincing,
has entranced the world’s population into blindly believing a maleficent
myth. We are told that though the earth has the appearance of
being a vast plane, with the sun moving high above and over the earth, that
what we see is a deception; it is an optical illusion - for it is not the sun
that moves, but the earth, with ‘ the sea and all that in them is,’ in the form
of a globe, whizzing with terrific rapidity round the sun, located millions of
miles away - its mean distance being assumed to be 91 millions of miles, and
that the earth travels at the rate of 68,000 miles an hour, or 19 miles every
second If the Government or NASA had said to you that the Earth is
stationary, imagine that. And then imagine we are trying to convince people
that 'no, no it's not stationary, it's moving forward at 32 times rifle bullet
speed and spinning at 1,000 miles per hour.' We would be laughed at! We would
have so many people telling us 'you are crazy, the Earth is not moving!' We
would be ridiculed for having no scientific backing for this convoluted moving
Earth theory. And not only that but then people would say, 'oh then how do you
explain a fixed, calm atmosphere and the Sun's observable movement, how do you
explain that?' Imagine saying to people, 'no, no, the atmosphere is moving also
but is somehow magically velcroed to the moving-Earth. The reason is not simply
because the Earth is stationary.' So what we are actually doing is what makes
sense. We are saying that the moving-Earth theory is nonsense. The
stationary-Earth theory makes sense and we are being ridiculed. You've got to
picture it being the other way around to realize just how RIDICULOUS this
situation is. This theory from the Government and NASA that the Earth is
rotating and orbiting and leaning over and wobbling is absolute nonsense and
yet people are clinging to it, tightly, like a teddy bear. They just can't
bring themselves to face the possibility that the Earth is stationary though
ALL the evidence shows it: we feel no movement, the atmosphere hasn't been
blown away, we see the Sun move from East-to-West, everything can be explained
by a motionless Earth without bringing in all these assumptions to cover up
previous assumptions gone bad If the Earth truly were a spinning ball orbiting the Sun,
there are several tests and experiments which could be, and have been, conducted
to prove or disprove the veracity of such a claim. For example, Danish Astronomer Tycho Brahe famously
argued against the heliocentric theory in his time, positing that if the Earth
revolved in an orbit round the Sun, the change in relative position of the
stars after 6 months of orbital motion could not fail to be seen. In actual fact, however, after almost two
hundred million miles of supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of
parallax can be detected in the stars! If the earth is at a given point in space on say January
1st, and according to present-day science, at a distance of 190,000,000 miles
from that point six months afterwards, it follows that the relative position
and directions of the stars will have greatly changed, however small the angle
of parallax may be. THAT THIS GREAT
CHANGE IS NOWHERE APPARENT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN OBSERVED, incontestably proves
that the earth is at rest - that it does not move in an orbit round the sun “Take two carefully-bored metallic tubes, not less than
six feet in length, and place them one yard asunder, on the opposite sides of a
wooden frame, or a solid block of wood or stone: so adjust them that their
centres or axes of vision shall be perfectly parallel to each other. Now,
direct them to the plane of some notable fixed star, a few seconds previous to
its meridian time. Let an observer be stationed at each tube and the moment the
star appears in the first tube let a loud knock or other signal be given, to be
repeated by the observer at the second tube when he first sees the same star. A
distinct period of time will elapse between the signals given. The signals will
follow each other in very rapid succession, but still, the time between is
sufficient to show that the same star is not visible at the same moment by two
parallel lines of sight when only one yard asunder. A slight inclination of the
second tube towards the first tube would be required for the star to be seen
through both tubes at the same instant. Let the tubes remain in their position
for six months; at the end of which time the same observation or experiment
will produce the same results--the star will be visible at the same meridian
time, without the slightest alteration being required in the direction of the
tubes: from which it is concluded that if the earth had moved one single yard
in an orbit through space, there would at least be observed the slight
inclination of the tube which the difference in position of one yard had
previously required. But as no such difference in the direction of the tube is
required, the conclusion is unavoidable, that in six months a given meridian
upon the earth's surface does not move a single yard, and therefore, that the
earth has not the slightest degree of orbital motion When Tycho Brahe demonstrated that after 190,000,000 miles of
supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax could be detected,
desperate heliocentrists, instead of conceding, doubled-down claiming the stars
were all actually trillions upon trillions of miles away from us, so distant
that no appreciable parallax could ever be detected! This convenient explanation, which
heliocentrists have clung to for centuries, has proven satisfactory to silence
the uninquisitive minds of the masses, but still fails to adequately address
many observable phenomena such as our wildly implausible synchronization with
Polaris and other improbabilities which will be addressed later. The idea that the Earth, if it were a globe, could
possibly move in an orbit of hundreds of millions of miles with such exactitude
that the cross-hairs in a telescope fixed on its surface would appear to glide
gently over a star ‘millions of millions’ of miles away is simply monstrous;
whereas, with a FIXED telescope, it matters not the distance of the stars,
though we suppose them to be as far off as the astronomer supposes them to be;
for, as Mr. Richard Proctor himself says, ‘the further away they are, the less
they will seem to shift.’ Why, in the name of common sense, should observers
have to fix their telescopes on solid stone bases so that they should not move
a hair's-breadth, - if the Earth on which they fix them moves at the rate of
nineteen miles in a second? Indeed, to believe that Mr. Proctor's mass of ‘six
thousand million million million tons’ is ‘rolling, surging, flying, darting on
through space for ever’ with a velocity compared with which a shot from a
cannon is a ‘very slow coach,’ with such unerring accuracy that a telescope
fixed on granite pillars in an observatory will not enable a lynx-eyed
astronomer to detect a variation in its onward motion of the thousandth part of
a hair's-breadth is to conceive a miracle compared with which all the miracles
on record put together would sink into utter insignificance. Captain R. J. Morrison,
the late compiler of ‘Zadkeil's Almanac’ says: ‘We declare that this motion is
all mere bosh; and that the arguments which uphold it are, when examined with
an eye that seeks for truth, mere nonsense, and childish absurdity Another experiment repeatedly performed to disprove Earth’s
supposed rotation under our feet is firing cannons vertically and horizontally
in all cardinal directions. If the Earth
were truly spinning Eastwards underneath us as the heliocentric model suggests
then vertically-fired cannonballs should fall significantly due West. In actual fact, though, whenever this has been
tested, vertically-fired cannonballs, perfectly aimed with a plumb line, lit
with a slow match, shoot upwards an average of 14 seconds ascending, 14 seconds
descending, and fall back to the ground no more than 2 feet away from the
cannon, sometimes directly back into the muzzle! If the Earth were actually spinning at the
supposed rate of 600-700 mph at the mid-latitudes of England and America where
the tests have been performed, the cannonballs should fall a full 8,400 feet,
or over a mile and a half behind the cannon! The following experiment has been tried many times, and
the reasonable deductions from it are entirely against any theory of earth’s
motion: A loaded cannon was set vertical by plumb-line and spirit-level and
fired. On several
occasions the ball returned to the mouth of the cannon, and never fell more
than 2 feet from its base. The ball would partake of two motions, the
one from the cannon vertical, and the other from the earth, from west to
east. In descending it would have no impulse from
the earth’s motion or from the cannon, and would fall in a straight line, but
during the time it were falling, the earth, with the cannon, would have travelled
on, and the ball would fall (allowing the world’s rotation to be 600 miles per
hour in England) more than a mile and a half behind the cannon Again, at this point, instead of conceding, desperate
heliocentrists triple-down claiming the reason cannonballs fall straight back
is because the magical properties of gravity allow Earth to somehow drag the
entire lower-atmosphere in perfect synchronization with its axial spin rendering
even such break-neck speeds completely unnoticeable to the observer and unmeasurable
by experimentation! This highly
implausible, though clever and convenient explanation only holds for vertically-fired
cannons, however. If cannons are instead
fired and measured in all cardinal directions, even the heliocentrists’
atmospheric-velcro trump-card becomes unplayable. North/South-firing cannonballs establish a
control, then the East-firing cannonballs should fall significantly farther
than all others and West-firing cannonballs should fall significantly closer
due to the supposed 19 mile per second Eastward rotation of the Earth. In actual fact, however, regardless of which
direction cannons are fired, North, South, East, or West, the distance covered
is always the same. “When sitting in a rapidly-moving railway carriage, let a spring-gun be fired
forward, or in the direction in which the train is moving. Again, let the same
gun be fired, but in the opposite direction; and it will be found that the ball
or other projectile will always go farther in the first case than in the
latter. If a person leaps backwards from a horse in full gallop, he cannot jump
so great a distance as he can by jumping forward. Leaping from a moving sledge,
coach, or other object, backwards or forwards, the same results are
experienced. Many other practical cases could be cited to show that any body
projected from another body in motion, does not exhibit the same behaviour as
it does when projected from a body at rest. Nor are the results the same when
projected in the same direction as that in which the body moves, as when
projected in the opposite direction; because, in the former case, the projected
body receives its momentum from the projectile force, that
of the moving body. Hence it would be found that if the earth is moving rapidly
from west to east, a cannon fired in a due easterly direction would send a ball
to a greater distance than it would if fired in a due westerly direction. But
the most experienced artillerymen - many of whom have had great practice, both
at home and abroad, in almost every latitude - have declared that no difference
whatever is observable. That in charging and pointing their guns, no difference
in the working is ever required. Gunners in war ships have noticed a
considerable difference in the results of their firing from guns at the bow,
when sailing rapidly towards the object fired at, and when firing from guns
placed at the stern while sailing away from the object: and in both cases the
results are different to those observed when firing from a ship at perfect
rest. These details of practical experience are utterly incompatible with
the supposition of a revolving earth It is in evidence that, if a projectile be fired from a
rapidly moving body in an opposite direction to that in which the body is
going, it will fall short of the distance at which it would reach the ground if
fired in the direction of motion. Now, since the Earth is said to move at the
rate of nineteen miles in a second of time, ‘from west to east,’ it would make
all the difference imaginable if the gun were fired in an opposite direction.
But, as, in practice, there is not the slightest difference, whichever way the
thing may be done, we have a forcible overthrow of all fancies relative to the
motion of the Earth During the Crimean War, the subject of artillery-fire in
connection with the Earth’s rotation became a hotly discussed topic among military
men, scientists, philosophers and statesmen. Around this time, on December 20th, 1857, British Prime Minister Lord
Palmerston wrote to the Secretary of War Lord Panmure, stating, “ There is an
investigation which it would be important and at the same time easy to make,
and that is, whether the rotation of the earth on its axis has any effect on
the curve of a cannon-ball in its flight. One should suppose that it has, and
that while the cannon-ball is flying in the air, impelled by the gunpowder in a
straight line from the cannon's mouth, the ball would not follow the rotation
of the earth in the same manner which it would do if lying at rest on the
earth's surface. If this be so, a ball fired in the meridional direction--that
is to say, due south or due north--ought to deviate to the west of the object
at which it was aimed, because during the time of flight, that object will have
gone to the east somewhat faster than the cannon-ball will have done… The trial
might be easily made in any place in which a free circle of a mile or more
radius could be obtained; and a cannon placed in the centre of that circle, and
fired alternately north, south, east, and west, with equal charges, would
afford the means of ascertaining whether each shot flew the same distance or
not. Several such experiments have since been performed and shown that
projectiles fired in various directions on Earth’s surface always cover
comparable distances with no appreciable difference whatsoever. These results are entirely against the theory
of a rotating, revolving world and serve as direct empirical evidence for the
stationary Earth. If the
Earth were spinning several hundred miles per hour beneath our feet, helicopter
pilots and hot-air balloonists should be able to simply ascend straight up,
hover, and wait for their lateral destinations to reach them! Since such a thing has never happened in the
history of aeronautics, however, haughty heliocentrists must once again rely on
Newton’s magical atmospheric-velcro, claiming the lower atmosphere (up to an
undetermined height, somewhere above the reach of helicopters, hot-air
balloons, and anything not built by NASA) is pulled perfectly along with the
rotating Earth rendering such experiments moot. Granting heliocentrists their atmospheric-glue supposition
helps them dismiss the results of vertically-fired cannonball experiments, but does
not and cannot help them explain away the results of horizontal cardinally-fired
cannonballs. Similarly, granting them
their magic-velcro helps dismiss the results of hovering helicopter and hot-air
balloon experiments, but does not and cannot explain away the results of
airplanes flying in cardinal directions. For instance, if both the Earth and its lower atmosphere are supposedly
rotating together Eastwards 1,038 miles per hour at the equator, then airplane
pilots would need to make an extra 1,038 mph compensation acceleration when
flying Westwards! Since no such compensations are ever
necessary except in the imaginations of astronomers, it follows that the Earth
does not move. If flying had been invented at the time of Copernicus, there is
no doubt that he would have soon realized that his contention regarding the
rotation of the earth was wrong, on account of the relation existing between
the speed of an aircraft and that of the earth’s rotation. The distance covered
by an aircraft would be reduced or increased by the speed of the rotation
according to whether such aircraft travelled in the same direction, or against
it. Thus, if the earth rotates, as it is said, at 1,000 miles an hour, and a
plane flies in the same direction at only 500 miles, it is obvious that its
place of destination will be farther removed every minute. On the other hand,
if flying took place in the direction opposite to that of the rotation, a
distance of 1,500 miles would be covered in one hour, instead of 500, since the
speed of the rotation is to be added to that of the plane. It could also be
pointed out that such a flying speed of 1,000 miles an hour, which is supposed
to be that of the earth’s rotation, has recently been achieved, so that an
aircraft flying at this rate in the same direction as that of the rotation
could not cover any ground at all. It would remain suspended in mid-air over
the spot from which it took off, since both speeds are equal. There would, in
addition, be no need to fly from one place to another situated on the same
latitude. The aircraft could just rise and wait for the desired country to
arrive in the ordinary course of the rotation, and then land The heliocentric theory, literally “flying” in the face of
direct observation, experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the
ball-Earth is spinning around its axis at 1,000 miles per hour, revolving
around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour, while the entire solar system rotates
around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour, and the Milky Way speeds
through the expanding Universe at over 670,000,000 miles per hour, yet no one
in history has ever felt a thing! We can
feel the slightest breeze on a summer’s day, but never one iota of air
displacement from these incredible speeds! Heliocentrists claim with a straight face that their ball-Earth spins at
a constant velocity dragging the atmosphere in such a manner as to perfectly
cancel all centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces so we do not feel the tiniest bit of motion,
perturbation, wind or air resistance! Such back-peddling, damage-control reverse-engineered explanations
certainly stretch the limits of credibility and the imagination, leaving much
to be desired by discerning minds. Dear Reader, do you feel the motion? I trow not, for if you did,
you would not so quietly be reading my book. I doubt not you have been, like
myself, on a railway platform when an express train rushed wildly past at the
rate of sixty-five miles per hour, when the concussion of the air almost
knocked you down. But how much more terrible would be the shock of the Earth's
calculated motion of sixty-five thousand miles per hour, one thousand times
faster than the speed of the railway express? Let ‘imagination’ picture to the mind what force air
would have which was set in motion by a spherical body of 8,000 miles in
diameter, which in one hour was spinning round 1,000 mph, rushing through space
at 65,000 mph and gyrating across the heavens 20,000 mph? Then let ‘conjecture’ endeavor to discover
whether the inhabitants on such a globe could keep their hair on? If the earth-globe rotates on its axis at the
terrific rate of 1,000 miles an hour, such an immense mass would of necessity
cause a tremendous rush of wind in the space it occupied. The wind would go all one way, and anything
like clouds which got ‘within the sphere of influence’ of the rotating sphere,
would have to go the same way. If the Earth and atmosphere are constantly revolving Eastwards at 1,000 mph,
how is it that clouds, wind, and weather patterns casually and unpredictably go
every which way, often travelling in opposing directions simultaneously? Why can we feel the slightest Westward breeze
but not the Earth’s incredible supposed 1,000 mph Eastward spin!? And how is it that the magic velcro of
gravity is strong enough to drag miles of Earth’s atmosphere along, but weak enough
to allow little bugs, birds, clouds and planes to travel freely unabated in any
direction? What about the lark which, at early morn, soars aloft,
trilling its lays of luscious melody? Why was it not swept away in the
tumultuous atmosphere? But it still continues singing, in happy ignorance of
any commotion in the heavens. Who has not noticed, on a calm Summer day, the
thistle-down floating listlessly in the air, and the smoke ascending, straight
as an arrow, from the peasant's cottage? Would not such light things as
thistle-down and smoke have to obey the impulse and go with the Earth also? But
they do not ""If the atmosphere rushes forward from west to east
continually, we are again obliged to conclude that whatever floats or is
suspended in it, at any altitude, must of necessity partake of its eastward
motion. A piece of cork, or any other body floating in still water, will be
motionless, but let the water be put in motion, in any direction whatever, and
the floating bodies will move with it, in the same direction and with the same
velocity. Let the experiment be tried in every possible way, and these results
will invariable follow. Hence if the earth's atmosphere is in constant motion
from west to east, all the different strata which are known to exist in it, and
all the various kinds of clouds and vapours which float in it must of
mechanical necessity move rapidly eastwards. But what is the fact? If we fix
upon any star as a standard or datum outside the visible atmosphere, we may
sometimes observe a stratum of clouds going for hours together in a direction
the very opposite to that in which the earth is supposed to be moving. Not only
may a stratum of clouds be seen moving rapidly from east to west, but at the
same moment other strata may often be seen moving from north to south, and from
south to north. It is a fact well known to aeronauts, that several strata of
atmospheric air are often moving in as many different directions at the same
time ... On almost any moonlight and cloudy night, different strata may be seen
not only moving in different directions but, at the same time, moving with
different velocities; some floating past the face of the moon rapidly and
uniformly, and others passing gently along, sometimes becoming stationary, then
starting fitfully into motion, and often standing still for minutes together. In his book “South Sea Voyages,” Arctic and Antarctic explorer Sir
James Clarke Ross, described his experience on the night of November 27th, 1839
and his conclusion that the Earth must be motionless: “The sky being very
clear, the planet Venus was seen near the zenith, notwithstanding the
brightness of the meridian sun. It enabled us to observe the higher stratum of
clouds to be moving in an exactly opposite direction to that of the wind--a
circumstance which is frequently recorded in our meteorological journal both in
the north-east and south-east trades, and has also often been observed by
former voyagers. Captain Basil Hall witnessed it from the summit of the Peak of
Teneriffe; and Count Strzelechi, on ascending the volcanic mountain of Kiranea,
in Owhyhee, reached at 4000 feet an elevation above that of the trade wind, and
experienced the influence of an opposite current of air of a different
hygrometric and thermometric condition … Count Strzelechi further informed me
of the following seemingly anomalous circumstance--that at the height of 6000
feet he found the current of air blowing at right angles to both the lower
strata, also of a different hygrometric and thermometric condition, but warmer
than the inter-stratum. Such a state of the atmosphere is compatible only
with the fact which other evidence has demonstrated, that the earth is at rest."" It is a well-known fact that clouds are continually seen
moving in all manner of directions - yes, and frequently, in different directions
at the same time - from west to east being as frequent a direction as any
other. Now, if the Earth were a globe,
revolving through space from west to east at the rate of nineteen miles in a
second, the clouds appearing to us to move towards the east would have to move
quicker than nineteen miles in a second to be thus seen; whilst those which
appear to be moving in the opposite direction would have no necessity to be
moving at all, since the motion of the Earth would be more than sufficient to cause
the appearance. But it only takes a little common sense to show us that it is
the clouds that move just as they appear to do, and that, therefore, the Earth
is motionless Heliocentrists believe the world beneath their feet is spinning a
mind-numbing 1,038 mph at the equator while perfectly pulling the entire
atmosphere along for the ride. Meanwhile
at the mid-latitudes of USA and Europe, they believe the world / atmosphere spin
around 900-700 mph decreasing gradually all the way down to 0 mph at the North
and South poles, where the stagnant atmosphere apparently never moves
completely escaping the grips of gravity’s magic velcro. This means at all
latitudes, every inch of the way, the atmosphere manages to perfectly coincide
with the supposed speed of the Earth compensating from 0 mph at the poles all
the way up to 1,038 mph at the equator, and every speed in between. These are
all lofty assumptions heliocentrists make without any experimental evidence to
back them up. In short, the sun, moon, and stars are actually doing precisely what
everyone throughout all history has seen them do. We do not believe what our
eyes tell us because we have been taught a counterfeit system which demands
that we believe what has never been confirmed by observation or experiment.
That counterfeit system demands that the Earth rotate on an 'axis' every 24
hours at a speed of over 1000 MPH at the equator. No one has ever, ever, ever
seen or felt such movement (nor seen or felt the 67,000MPH speed of the Earth's
alleged orbit around the sun or its 500,000 MPH alleged speed around a galaxy
or its retreat from an alleged 'Big Bang' at over 670,000,000 MPH!). Remember,
no experiment has ever shown the earth to be moving. Add to that the fact that
the alleged rotational speed we've all been taught as scientific fact MUST
decrease every inch or mile one goes north or south of the equator, and it
becomes readily apparent that such things as accurate aerial bombing in WWII
(down a chimney from 25,000 feet with a plane going any direction at high
speed) would have been impossible if calculated on an earth moving below at
several hundred MPH and changing constantly with the latitude Before heliocentric indoctrination any child will look up to
the sky and notice that the Sun, Moon, and stars all revolve around a
stationary Earth. All evidence from our perspective clearly demonstrates that
we are fixed and the heavenly bodies circle around us. We feel the Earth as
motionless and observe the Sun, Moon, stars and planets to be moving
entities. To suspend this common-sense
geocentric perspective and assume that it is actually the Earth rotating
beneath us daily while revolving around the sun yearly is quite a theoretical
leap to take without any empirical evidence to land on. Ignorant folk think that such minority opinions as
Geocentrism are the 'conspiracy theories.’ There is a real conspiracy for sure
but the sad thing is it is mostly a conspiracy of willful and apathetic
ignorance (for numerous reasons). The very people who would call Geocentrists
'quack conspiracy theorists' are either themselves completely ignorant of even
modern cosmological axioms and principles of gravitation and mechanics or they
are just 'playing stupid,' hoping that no one will notice or call their bluff …
What’s even more hilarious is the fact that even folk like Steven Hawking and a
few intellectually honest physicists and cosmologists who would read what we
are saying and are capable of understanding it, know that what we have been
saying is absolutely true. Not only do
they admit that but even 'snicker' about it to each other, but they won't dare
to address that too openly with the dumb, ignorant masses... best not to
confuse the common folk with unnecessary information and facts. Even more sad
are all the others out there who don’t have a clue what I’m saying here and
shake their heads thinking they know something about physics that tells them
that the Earth moves. If only they studied the text books and peer-reviewed
papers a little closer, they would realize just how absolutely ignorant with a
capital 'I' that"
40,The Globe Earth Lie,"For almost 500
years, the masses have been thoroughly deceived by a cosmic fairy-tale of
astronomical proportions. We have been
taught a falsehood so gigantic and diabolical that it has blinded us from our
own experience and common sense, from seeing the world and the universe as they
truly are. Through pseudo-science books and programs, mass media and public
education, universities and government propaganda, the world has been systematically
brain-washed, slowly indoctrinated over centuries into the unquestioning belief
of the greatest lie of all time. Children are taught in their geography books, when too young to
apprehend aright the meaning of such things, that the world is a great globe
revolving around the Sun, and the story is repeated continuously, year by year,
till they reach maturity, at which time they generally become so absorbed in
other matters as to be indifferent as to whether the teaching be true or not,
and, as they hear of nobody contradicting it, they presume that it must be the
correct thing, if not to believe at least to receive it as a fact. They thus
tacitly give their assent to a theory which, if it had first been presented to
them at what are called ‘years of discretion,’ they would at once have
rejected. The consequences of
evil-teaching, whether in religion or in science, are far more disastrous than
is generally supposed, especially in a luxurious laisser faire age like our
own. The intellect becomes weakened and the conscience seared -David Wardlaw Scott, “Terra Firma: The Earth
Not a Planet Proved From Scripture, Reason, and Fact” (26) For 500 years an elite cabal of
Sun-worshippers has propagated this nihilistic, atheistic cosmology / cosmogony
unquestioningly believed by the vast majority of the world. We have been taught, contrary to all common
sense and experience, that the seemingly motionless, flat Earth beneath our
feet is actually a massive moving ball spinning through space at over 1,000
miles per hour, wobbling and tilted 23.5 degrees on its vertical axis, while
orbiting the sun at a blinding 67,000 miles per hour, in concert with the
entire solar system spiraling 500,000 miles per hour around the Milky Way and
careening across the expanding universe away from the “Big Bang” at an
incredible 670,000,000 miles per hour, but that you feel and experience none of
it! We have been taught that a
mysterious force called “gravity,” a magical magnetism responsible for keeping
everything from falling or flying off the spinning ball-Earth, is just strong
enough to hold people, oceans, and the atmosphere tightly to the surface, but
just weak enough to allow bugs, birds and planes to take off with ease! Whilst we sit drinking our
cup of tea or coffee the world is supposedly rotating at 1,039 mph at the
equator, whizzing around the Sun at 66,500 mph, hurtling towards Lyra at 20,000
mph, revolving around the centre of the 'Milky Way' at 500,000 mph and merrily
moving at God knows what velocity as a consequence of the 'Big Bong.' And not
even a hint of a ripple on the surface of our tea, yet tap the table lightly
with your finger and ... ! I remember being taught when a boy, that the Earth was a
great ball, revolving at a very rapid rate around the Sun, and, when I
expressed to my teacher my fears that the waters of the oceans would tumble
off, I was told that they were prevented from doing so by Newton’s great law of
Gravitation, which kept everything in its proper place. I presume that my countenance must have shown
some signs of incredulity, for my teacher immediately added - I can show you a
direct proof of this; a man can whirl around his head a pail filled with water
without its being spilt, and so, in like manner, can the oceans be carried
round the Sun without losing a drop. As
this illustration was evidently intended to settle the matter, I then said no
more upon the subject. Had such been
proposed to me afterwards as a man, I would have answered somewhat as follows -
Sir, I beg to say that the illustration you have given of a man whirling a pail
of water round his head, and the oceans revolving round the Sun, does not in
any degree confirm your argument, because the water in the two cases is placed
under entirely different circumstances, but, to be of any value, the conditions
in each case must be the same, which here they are not. The pail is a hollow vessel which holds the
water inside it, whereas, according to your teaching, the Earth is a ball, with
a continuous curvature outside, which, in agreement with the laws of nature,
could not retain any water. -David
Wardlaw Scott, “Terra Firma: The Earth Not a Planet Proved From Scripture,
Reason, and Fact” (1-2) We have been taught that the ball-Earth spins at a constant velocity
perfectly dragging the atmosphere along so we cannot feel the slightest bit of
motion, perturbation, wind, or air resistance. They say we cannot feel any of this motion because the magical velcro of
gravity pulls the atmosphere precisely along, and we cannot measure any of this
motion because the stars are so incredibly far away that over a hundred million
miles of supposed annual orbit around the Sun amounts to not a single inch of
relative parallax change! We have been taught that the
apparent orbit of the Sun, planets, and stars (but not the Moon!) around the
Earth are all optical illusions, that it is in fact the Earth beneath our feet
which moves, and our eyes that deceive us. Special exception is made for the Moon, however, which is said to
revolve around Earth just as it appears. Since we only ever see one side of the Moon, we have been taught this is
because the Moon’s supposed 10.3 mph West to East rotation combined with its
2,288 mph orbit of Earth just happens to be the EXACT motion and speed
necessary to perfectly cancel out the Earth’s supposed 1,000 mph East to West
rotation and 67,000 mph orbit of the Sun, thereby creating the perpetual dark
side of the Moon illusion! Though the Sun and Moon appear to be relatively small equal-sized
bodies revolving around a stationary Earth, we have been taught that this too
is an optical illusion, and they are in fact thousands of miles divergent in
diameter! They say the Sun is actually a
whopping 865,374 miles across, 109 times wider than the Earth, and, contrary to
all experience, experiments, and common sense, that we revolve around it! They say the Moon is 2,159 miles across, a
quarter the size of the Earth, and why they appear the same size is because the
Moon is “only” 238,000 miles away, while the Sun is an unfathomable 93,000,000
miles away from the Earth, and these just happen to be the EXACT diameters and
distances necessary for a viewer from Earth to “falsely” perceive them as being
the same size! A sphere where people on the other side live with their feet
above their heads, where rain, snow and hail fall upwards, where trees and
crops grow upside-down and the sky is lower than the ground? The ancient wonder of the hanging gardens of
Babylon dwindle into nothing in comparison to the fields, seas, towns and
mountains that pagan philosophers believe to be hanging from the earth without
support! I confess that I cannot imagine how any human being, in
his proper senses, can believe that the Sun is stationary when, with his own
eyes, he sees it revolving around the heavens, nor how he can believe that the
Earth, on which he stands, is whirling with the speed of lightning around the
Sun, when he feels not the slightest motion We have been taught that those
tiny pin pricks of light in the night sky known as planets, or wandering stars,
are actually physical, globular, Earth-like habitations millions of miles away. We have
been taught that the tiny pin pricks of light in the night sky known as the
fixed stars, are actually distant suns trillions of miles away each complete
with their own solar systems, orbiting moons, and Earth-like 
 
 
planets which potentially harbor alien life! We have been taught that the Moon has no light of its own
but is merely a reflector of the Sun’s light, that some Masons from NASA
actually walked on the Moon, that some other Masons from NASA sent rovers to
Mars, that satellites and space stations are incessantly spinning in suspended
animation above the earth, that Hubble telescopes are taking snapshots of
distant planets, galaxies, stars, quasars, black holes, worm holes, and other fantastic
celestial phenomena. We have been taught
that our ignorant ancient ancestors for millennia falsely believed the Earth to
be the flat, immovable center of the universe, but thanks to modern “science”
and its Masonic prophets like Copernicus, Newton, Galileo, Collins, Aldrin and
Armstrong we now believe the world to be a giant whirling sea-earth globe
careening through infinite space. Modern astronomical teaching affirms that the world we
live on is a globe, which rotates, revolves and spins away in space at
brain-reeling rates of speed; that the sun is a million and a half times the
volume of the earth-globe, and nearly a hundred million miles distant from it;
that the moon is about a quarter the size of earth; that it receives all its
light from the sun, and is thus only a reflector, and not a giver of light;
that it attracts the body of the earth and thus causes the tides; that the
stars are worlds and suns, some of them equal in importance to our own sun
himself, and others vastly his superior; that these worlds, inhabited by
sentient beings, are without numbers and occupy space boundless in extent and
illimitable in duration; the whole of these interlaced bodies being subject to,
and supported by, universal gravitation, the foundation and father of the whole
fabric. To fanciful minds and
theoretical speculators, the so-called ‘science’ of modern astronomy furnishes
a field, unsurpassed in any science for the unrestrained license of the
imagination, and the building up of a complicated conjuration of absurdities
such as to overawe the simpleton and make him gape with wonder; to deceive even
those who truly believe their assumptions to be facts. We have been taught that
“science” books like Newton’s Principia Mathematica which propound the
spherical heliocentric myth are the bearers of truth while backwater
“religious” books like the Holy Bible which propound a flat, geocentric Earth
are merely outdated myths. We have been taught that the universe was
unintelligently designed and randomly created in a cosmic coincidence of
nothing inexplicably becoming everything! We have been taught that through millions upon millions of years of accidental
“evolution” and happenstance the Big Bang universe began manifesting suns,
moons, planets, then water, then somehow out of dead, inert elements, single-celled
conscious organisms came to life, grew and multiplied and mutated into larger,
different organisms which continued to grow, multiply and mutate gaining diversity
and complexity (and losing credibility) to the point where amphibians crawled
up on land, replaced gills with lungs, started breathing air, maturated into
mammals, became bipedal, grew opposable thumbs, evolved into monkeys, then in
one final fluke adaptation a hybrid monkey-man was made and the rest is human
history. Put together all the imaginary exploits in the air
specially written to interest the young, add to this all the wonderful
adventures of air-ships recorded in the ‘Daughter of the Revolution,’ and tack
on to this all the wild and impossible things found in current libraries of fiction, and I venture to say that the
grand total will record nothing so utterly impossible or so supremely
ridiculous as this modern scientific delusion of a globe spinning away in space
in several different directions at the same time, at rates of speed which no
man is able to grasp: with the inhabitants, some hanging heads down and others
at various angles to suit the inclination. Write down all the swindles that ever were perpetrated; name all the
hoaxes you ever heard of or read about; include all the impostures and bubbles
ever exposed; make a list of all the snares that popular credulity could ever
be exposed to, and you will fail in getting within sight or hearing of an
imposture so gross, a hoax so ingenious, or a bubble of such gigantic
proportions as has been perpetrated and forced upon unthinking multitudes in
the name of science, and as proved incontrovertible fact, by the expounders of
modern astronomy. Again and again have
their theories been combated and exposed, but as often have the majority, who
do not think for themselves, accepted the popular thing We have been taught that the
height of stupidity and naivety was when our ignorant ancestors believed the
Earth to be flat, and that if any man somehow still thinks the Earth to be the
immovable center of the universe, that they must be the most primitive kind of
ignoramus. Nowadays the label “Flat-Earther” has become literally
synonymous with “moron” and is a common cliché derogatory term for insulting
someone’s intelligence. Upon seeing a
book titled “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” your ingrained instinct was likely to
laugh, mock the messenger, and deny the very possibility. What strikes you as being some thoughts that people would have if
- in the short space of a few weeks - the universally held conviction that the
Earth rotates on an axis daily and orbits the sun annually were exposed as an
unscientific deception? Keep in mind that a rotating, orbiting earth is not
counted as a mere hypothesis or even a theory anywhere in the world today. Oh
no. Rather, this concept is an unquestioned 'truth'; an established 'fact' in
all books and other media everywhere, church media included. Copernicanism, in
short, is a concept that is protected in a bunker under a 50 foot thick ceiling
of solid 'scientific' concrete. It is meant to be impregnable. It is a concept
that has become ensconced in men’s minds as the indestructible cornerstone of
enlightened modern man’s knowledge. Virtually all people everywhere have been
taught to believe - and do believe - that this concept is based on objective
science and dispassionate secular reasoning. Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would give the same answer to the interrogation; and that same answer would be to the effect that ‘the earth is a globe which revolves round the sun.’  The ninety-nine who makes this reply would do it because they ‘know it is the case.’ (!!!)  ‘How do they know it?’  Let this question be put to them, and they will bestow upon you a withering smile of pity at what they conceive to be an imbecility of mind on your part, and answer you in something like the following style: ‘It always has been so.  We learnt it at school.  Clever men say so; and look how astronomers can foretell eclipses;’ and then lose their temper at ‘the very idea’ of the globular theory being incorrect, and a haughty ‘ there can’t be a doubt about it,’ will close all they have to say on the subject.  Now, if the ears of these ninety-nine could only be gained, they would be shown in an irresistible manner that the philosophy which would speak of a round and revolving world is a false philosophy."
41,The Flat Earth Truth,"In the Middle Ages people believed that the earth was
flat, for which they had at least the evidence of their senses: we believe it
to be round, not because as many as one percent of us could give the physical
reasons for so quaint a belief, but because modern science has convinced us
that nothing that is obvious is true, and that everything that is magical,
improbable, extraordinary, gigantic, microscopic, heartless or outrageous is
‘scientific. Modern astronomy has absolutely convinced the world, as George
Bernard Shaw stated, that nothing that is obvious is true. It is obvious that the Earth is flat, yet
they say it is curved; it is obvious that the world is motionless, yet they say
that it moves; it is obvious that the heavens revolve around us, yet they say
it is us that revolves; it is obvious that the stars are stars yet they say the
stars are suns; it is obvious that the Sun is bigger than the stars, yet they
say the stars are bigger than the Sun; it is obvious that the Sun and Moon are
the same size, yet they say the Sun is 400 times larger; it is obvious that
Earth is the only “planet,” yet they say there are over a septillion
(1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) planets; it is obvious that up is up and
down is down, yet they say it is not so! With the Modem Astronomer there is theoretically neither
‘Up’ nor ‘Down,’ though his experience belies his assertion, every time he
looks ‘up’ to the heavens or ‘down’ to the ground. Such aberration of intellect
is really to be pitied Astronomer Denison Olmsted, in describing a diagram
which is supposed to represent the Earth as a globe, with a figure of a man
sticking out at each side and one hanging head downwards, says ‘We should dwell
on this point until it appears to us as truly up,’ In the direction given to
these figures as it does with regard to a figure which he has placed on the
top! Now, a system of philosophy which
requires us to do something which is, really, the going out of our minds, by
dwelling on an absurdity until we think it is a fact, cannot be a system based
on God's truth, which never requires anything of the kind. Since, then, the
popular theoretical astronomy of the day requires this, it is evident that it
is the wrong thing, and that this conclusion furnishes us with a proof that the
Earth is not a globe The physical properties of a physical globe would create
insurmountable difficulties for the being called ‘man’ for man is a two-legged,
smooth-footed, clawless-toed, and heavily-built creature. Consider him magnetized through his boots to
the center of the globe, where the ‘big magnet’ is located. Picture him looking down in to the gaseous
void, with his eyes gouging out of their sockets and his heart in his mouth;
and his prayer that his ‘hob-nailed’ boots will not lose their magnetism. It should be obvious that up truly is up and down truly is
down, that flat truly is flat, and still truly is still. It should be obvious the universe was
intelligently designed by an intelligent designer, purposefully created by a
purposeful creator. Yet modern “science”
and “astronomy” through centuries of deception and manipulation have obfuscated
the obvious and left people blinded to the simple truth. The one thing the fable of the revolving Earth has done,
it has shown the terrible power of a lie, a lie has the power to make a man a
mental slave, so that he dares not back the evidence of his own senses. When he feels
himself standing on an Earth utterly devoid of motion, at the suggestion of
someone else he is prepared to accept that he is spinning furiously round. When he sees a bird flying, and gaining over
the ground, he is prepared to believe that the ground is really travelling a
great number of times faster than the bird, finally, in order to uphold the imagination
of a madman, he is prepared to accuse his Maker of forming him a sensiferous
lie. Just as it
appears, the Sun, Moon and stars (fixed and wandering) all revolve around the
flat Earth which is Polaris, the
North Pole star remains always significantly situated atop the dome of the
heavens, while the Sun, Moon, and stars revolve in circular cycles around
us. The truth is pilots do not make constant nose
declinations or compensation acceleration to account for the supposed curvature
and rotation of the ball-Earth. Rational people believe Salisbury Plain to be a Plane,
and Lake Windermere to be horizontal, but our Astronomers say that this is all
a mistake, that we must not trust our eyes, when we see these or other such
places, as being horizontal, but that we should believe what they tell us, that
Salisbury Plain, Lake Windermere, as also all other plains, lakes, and places
upon the Earth, as well as the vast Pacific and all other oceans, are only
parts of a great Globe, and, therefore, must have a curve; besides which,
mirabile dictu, that all rush together round the Sun at the rate of 65,000
miles per hour! They give their law for this fancied curvature, based on the
world being 25,000 miles in circumference at the Equator, as being 8 inches for
the first mile, 2 feet 8 inches for the second, 6 feet for the third, and so
on, the rule being to square the number of miles between the observer and the
object, then multiply that square by 8 inches and divide by 12 to bring it into
feet, the quotient being the supposed curvature. Unfortunately, however, for
Astronomers, this theory does not agree with fact, for this rule of curvature
has been found to be utterly fallacious both on land and water. All houses have
to be built on level ground, but no allowance whatever is made for the
curvature of the Earth, and all compasses point North and South at the same
time even at the Equator, which incontestably proves that the sea is
horizontal, and, therefore, that the world is not globular, for if it were, one
end of the magnet would then dip towards the North and the other point to the
Heavens The Moon is not merely a reflector of the
Sun’s light but emanates a demonstrably unique light of its own; It is completely
self-luminescent and semi-transparent. The
truth is that man has not and cannot ever walk on the Moon or Mars because the
heavenly bodies are simply luminaries and not terrestrial terra firma like the
Earth. Orbiting satellites and space stations do not
exist; all video and photographs you have ever seen from NASA, Hubble, and
other “official” sources are all CGI (computer-generated images). , purposefully created by a purposeful creator, not the
haphazard result of some inexplicable cosmic accident. The truth is that life, consciousness, the
incredible beautiful diversity and complexity of nature is divinely created, When we consider what the advocates of the Earth's stationary and
central position can account for, and explain their celestial phenomena as
accurately to their own thinking as we can ours, in addition to which they have
the evidence of their SENSES and Scripture and facts in their favour, which we
have not; it is not without a show of reason that they maintain the superiority
of their system . . . However perfect our theory may appear in our own
estimation, and however simply and satisfactorily the Newtonian hypotheses may
seem to us to account for all the celestial phenomena, yet we are here
compelled to admit the astounding truth, if our premises be disputed and our
facts challenged, The more I consider them the more I doubt all systems of
Astronomy; I doubt whether we can with certainty know either the distances or
the magnitude of any star in the firmament, else why do Astronomers so
immensely differ with regard to the distance of the Sun from the Earth? Letters from various
parts testify that, in some cases, men and women have begun to make use of
their brain-power, which had been stunted and dwarfed by acceptation, without
the slightest proof, of the unscientific, unreasonable, unnatural and infidel
teachings of men foisted upon a credulous public in the name of ‘Science.’ Others again, tell that the writers have
thrown to the moles and to the bats the world-wide and almost universally
believed hoax that we are living on a whirling sea-earth globe, revolving
faster than a cannonball travels, rushing through ‘space’ at a rate beyond
human power to conceive, and flying - with the whole of the so-called ‘solar
system’ - in another direction twenty times the speed of its rotation. -Thomas Winship, “Zetetic Cosmogeny -
Conclusive Evidence That the World is Not a Rotating Revolving Globe But a
Stationary Plane Circle.” (ii) In conspiracy research, the term “globalist” usually refers to
“internationalists,” people in favor of a one world order, but more literally
and more accurately, as the U.N. world government logo shows, the term
“globalist” signifies those who propagate the centuries old myth of a globe
Earth. In typical
sun-worshipping fashion the Sun was made to be the most important and central
entity of the so-called “solar system.” The Sun was said to be the
only giver of light and the Moon demoted to a mere reflector of the Sun’s
light. The Sun was said to be the
largest thing in our corner of the galaxy, bigger than the Earth, Moon and planets! By removing Earth from the motionless center of the
Universe, these Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place
of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth
is the center of the Universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose
for human existence are resplendent. But if the Earth is just one of billions
of planets revolving around billions of stars in billions of galaxies, then the
ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence
become highly implausible. By surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist
Sun-worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain
absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism
and consumerism. Their rich, powerful corporations with slick
Sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we
tacitly believe their “science,” vote for their politicians, buy their
products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls
at the altar of materialism. Such discrepancies remind me of the confusion which attended
those who in olden days attempted to build the Tower of Babel, when their
language was confounded, and their labour brought to nought. But no wonder is
it that their calculations are all wrong, seeing they proceed from a wrong
basis. They assumed the world to be a Planet, with a circumference of 25,000
miles, and took their measurements from its supposed centre, and from supposed
spherical angles of measurement on the surface. Again, how could such
measurements possibly be correct while, as we are told, the Earth was whirling
around the Sun faster than a cannon ball, at the rate of eighteen miles per
second, a force more than sufficient to kill every man, woman, and child on its
surface in less than a minute? Then, the Earth is supposed to have various
other motions, into the discussion of which I need not enter here, and will
only notice that of its supposed rotation round its imaginary axis at the rate,
at the Equator, of a thousand miles per hour, with an inclination of 23.5
degrees Ptolemy had made it appear
that the sun and stars revolved around a stationary earth, but Copernicus
advanced the theory that it was the earth which revolved around a stationary
sun, while the stars were fixed; and either of these entirely opposite theories
gives an equally satisfactory explanation of the appearance of the sun by day
and the stars by night. Copernicus did not produce any newly discovered fact to
prove that Ptolemy was wrong, neither did he offer any proof that he himself
was right, but worked out his system to show that he could account for all the
appearances of the heavens quite as well as the Egyptians had done, though
working on an entirely different hypothesis; and offered his new Heliocentric
Theory as an alternative. Ptolemy shows
very ingeniously that the Earth must be at the centre of the celestial sphere.
He proves that unless this were the case, each star would not move with the
absolute uniformity which does characterise it. He shows also that the Earth
could not be animated by any movement of transition. ‘The Earth,’ argued Ptolemy,
‘lies at the centre of the celestial sphere. If the Earth were to be endowed
with movement, it would not lie always at this point, it must therefore shift
to some other part of the sphere. The movements of the stars, however, preclude
this, and therefore the Earth must be as devoid of any movement of translation
as it is of rotation.’ The Ptolemaic Geocentric system prevailed for over 1,400
years and even thousands of years before Ptolemy, Flat-Earth Geocentricism was
the widely accepted truth. The modern
Ball-Earth Heliocentricism popularized by the likes of Copernicus, Kepler,
Galileo, Newton, Einstein, and NASA, however, is a comparatively recent belief
system that has been foisted upon an unsuspecting world for 500 years. Ptolemy never imagined the scientific
magicians of the future would be so brazen, nor the public so gullible, as to
accept that we see no parallax change in the stars after hundreds of millions
of miles of supposed orbital motion, simply because all those stars are
trillions upon trillions of miles further distant at a sufficient enough scale
for no change in relative parallax to occur! They expect us to ‘believe’ that the earth and sea
together comprise a flying globe (which they speak of as a solid ‘orb,’
supposed by astronomers to have been ‘originally shot off the sun in a soft
plastic mass, which, as the temperature decreased, gradually solidified,’) yet
not one single fact or proof can they produce for this far-fetched idea, and in
spite of the fact that the whirling globe theory was (even according to the
open confessions of its founders) set forth to the world in the first instance
as a mere ‘supposition,’ it is now presented as unquestionable truth It was said, in effect, by Newton, and has ever since
been insisted upon by his disciples: ‘Allow us, without proof, which is
impossible, the existence of two universal forces--centrifugal and centripetal,
or attraction and repulsion, and we will construct a theory which shall explain
all the leading phenomena and mysteries of nature.’ An apple falling from a
tree, or a stone rolling downwards, and a pail of water tied to a string and
set in motion were assumed to be types of the relations existing among all the
bodies in the universe. The moon was assumed to have a tendency to fall towards
the earth, and the earth and moon together towards the sun. The same relation
was assumed to exist between all the smaller and larger luminaries in the
firmament; and it soon became necessary to extend these assumptions to
infinity. The universe was parcelled out into systems--co-existent and
illimitable. Suns, planets, satellites, and comets, were assumed to exist
infinite in number and boundless in extent; and to enable the theorists to
explain alternating and constantly recurring phenomena, which were everywhere
observable, these numberless and for-ever-extending objects were assumed to be
spheres. The earth we inhabit was called a planet, and because it was thought
to be reasonable that the luminous objects in the firmament, which were called
planets, were spherical and had motion, so it was only reasonable to suppose
that, as the earth was a planet, it must also be spherical and have
motion--ergo, the earth is a globe and moves upon axes, and in an orbit round
the sun! And as the earth is a globe and is inhabited, so again it is only
reasonable to conclude that the planets are worlds like the earth, and are
inhabited by sentient beings. What reasoning! What shameful perversion of
intellectual gifts! Copernicus put forward the hypothesis of the revolution
of the earth round the sun in order to explain the cycle of the seasons. His
theory is not very satisfactory seeing that the earth is supposed to be at its
greatest distance from the sun in the summer during the hot weather, and at its
shortest distance in the winter when the temperature is at its lowest. These
unusual conditions which clearly contradict the laws of nature as regards the
effects of heat, are, it is said, due to the angle formed by the rays of the
sun as they fall on the earth’s surface. It is also stated that the opposition
of the seasons north and south of the equator is due to a tilt of the earth,
first on one side, and then on the other, which conveniently occurs at the
right moment. Nothing is said, however,
of the shifting of the waters of the sea and rivers which this change in the
centre of gravity and in the position of the earth would inevitably bring twice
a year. It might also be assumed that under those conditions, very high
constructions would swerve from the vertical. The American sky-scrapers and the
Eiffel Tower, for instance, cannot be seen to lean right or left according to
the seasons, although this should be a logical and natural consequence of the
alternate inclination attributed to the earth If the Earth were a sphere that rotated daily on its
vertical axis at a uniform velocity, revolving annually around the Sun, it
would follow that half the “globe” would always be sunlit while the other half
dark, every place on the globe receiving an equal amount of day and night. In actuality, however, the drastically
varying lengths of day/night over the Earth are consistent with the Geocentric
Flat-Earth model. If the Earth were a
sphere it would follow that seasons the world over would be simultaneous due to
distance from the Sun. When the Earth is
farthest away from the Sun, the entire globe should be ensconced in winter and
recording the coldest temperatures for the year. When the Earth is closest to the Sun, the
entire globe should be summery and recording the warmest temperatures for the
year. The frozen depths of
Antarctica remain forever frigidly foreboding while just a few thousand miles
away it is tropical summer. How is it
that the heat from the Sun could supposedly come from an eyebrow-raising 93
million miles away to simultaneously burn the skin of beach bums in Hawaii
while leaving Antarctic explorers frozen in their boots just a few thousand
miles away? It is geometrically demonstrable that all the visible
luminaries in the firmament are within a distance of a few thousand miles from
the earth, not more than the space which stretches between the North Pole and
the Cape of Good Hope; and the principle of measurement - that of plane
triangulation with, invariably, an accurately measured base line - which
demonstrates this important fact is one which no mathematician claiming to be a
master in the science will for a moment deny. All these luminaries, then, and
the sun itself, being so near to us, cannot be other than very small as
compared with the earth we inhabit. They are all in motion over the earth,
which is alone immovable; and, therefore, they cannot be anything more than
secondary and subservient structures continually ministering to this fixed
world and its inhabitants. This is a plain, simple, and in every respect
demonstrable philosophy, agreeing with the evidence of our senses, borne out by
every fairly instituted experiment, and never requiring a violation of those
principles of investigation which the human mind has ever recognized and
depended upon in its every-day life. The modern or Newtonian astronomy has none
of these characteristics. The whole system taken together constitutes a most
monstrous absurdity. It is false in its foundation; irregular, unfair, and
illogical, in its details; and, in its conclusions, inconsistent and
contradictory. Worse than all, it is a prolific source of irreligion and of
atheism, of which its advocates are practically supporters. By defending a
system which is directly opposed to that which is taught in connection with the
Jewish and Christian religion they lead the more critical and daring intellects
to question and deride the cosmogony and general philosophy contained in the
sacred books. Because the Newtonian theory is held to be true they are led
to reject the Scriptures altogether, to ignore the worship, and doubt and deny
the existence of a Creator and Supreme Ruler of the world The facts and experiments already advanced render it
undeniable, that the surface of all the waters of the earth is horizontal; and
that however irregular the upper outline of the land itself may be, the whole
mass, land and water together, constitutes an IMMENSE NON-MOVING CIRCULAR
PLANE. If we travel by land or sea, from
any part of the earth in the direction of any meridian line, and towards the
northern central star called ‘Polaris,’ we come to one and the same place, a
region of ice, where the star which has been our guide is directly above us, or
vertical to our position. This region is really THE CENTRE OF THE EARTH; and
recent observations seem to prove that it is a vast central tidal sea, nearly a
thousand miles in diameter, and surrounded by a great wall or barrier of ice,
eighty to a hundred miles in breadth. If from this central region we trace the
outline of the lands which project or radiate from it, and the surface of which
is above the water, we find that the present form of the earth or ‘dry land,’
as distinguished from the waters of the ‘great deep,’ is an irregular
mass of capes, bays, and islands, terminating in great bluffs or headlands,
projecting principally towards the south, or, at least, in a direction away
from the great northern centre. If now we sail with our backs continually to
this central star, ‘Polaris,’ or the centre of the earth's surface, we shall
arrive at another region of ice. Upon whatever meridian we sail, keeping the
northern centre behind us, we are checked in our progress by vast and lofty
cliffs of ice. If we turn to the right or to the left of our meridian, these
icy barriers beset us during the whole of our passage. Hence, we have found
that there is a great ebbing and flowing sea at the earth's centre; with a boundary
wall of ice, nearly a hundred miles in thickness, and three thousand miles in
circumference; that springing or projecting from this icy wall, irregular
masses of land stretch out towards the south, where a desolate waste of
turbulent waters surrounds the continents, and is itself engirdled by vast
belts and packs of ice, bounded by immense frozen barriers, the lateral depth
and extent of which are utterly unknown. How far the ice extends; how it terminates; and what exists beyond it,
are questions to which no present human experience can reply. All we at present
know is, that snow and hail, howling winds, and indescribable storms and
hurricanes prevail; and that in every direction human ingress is barred by
unsealed escarpments of perpetual ice, extending farther than eye or telescope
can penetrate, and becoming lost in gloom and darkness What remains unknown at this time are 1) the extent of the Antarctic
ice-wall, how far can one travel Southwards atop the ice? Is it just water, snow, ice, and darkness
forever, or is there some limit, like the glass wall in The Truman Show? Is the universe infinite, or as the Bible
claims, contained within a physical “firmament,” the “vault of heaven?” If the earth is a distinct structure standing in and
upon the waters of the ‘great deep,’ it follows that, unless it can be shown
that something else sustains the waters, that the depth is fathomless. As there is no evidence whatever of anything
existing underneath the ‘great deep,’ and as in many parts of the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans no bottom has been found by the most scientific and efficient
means which human ingenuity could invent, we are forced to the conclusion that
the depth is boundless From the earliest times it has been believed and said that the
heavens were not an empty space, but a solid surface. The Chaldeans and
Egyptians regarded the sky as the massive cover of the world; and in India and
Persia it was thought to be a metallic lid, flat or convex, or even pyramidal.
Up to the 17th century the earth was always regarded as the centre of an empty
sphere with solid walls; and on this account, it was always represented with a
cover. This indispensable complement, however, was eliminated upon the advent
of the theory of gravitation, for convenience sake, as a solid dome limiting
the space round the earth would have rendered impossible the extravagant
motions of the planets which were sent revolving in the air at phenomenal
distances. Thus from this time, the fact universally accepted for thousands of
years that the sky is a firm surface, completely disappeared. Nevertheless, the possible existence of a
solid vault over the earth is a question of great importance in view of the
tremendous consequences which would result from this fact, if it happened to be
true. There is no doubt that the general reaction is one of incredulity; but,
on the other hand, it can be considered that it is not without reason that the
ancients believed in the existence of the material vault of heaven; nor without
reason, either, that this notion should have been consistently handed down
through the ages since the earliest times up to the 17th century, in all parts
of the world … The planets are not solid, opaque masses of matter, as is believed.
They are simply immaterial, luminous and transparent discs; and in view of
these circumstances, it is plain that the craters, asperities, mountains and
valleys which were thought to exist on the surface of these imaginary masses,
are the topographic features of the solid vault of the sky which are
illuminated and thrown into relief by the luminous and transparent discs which
we call planets. It is also to be realized that the lens of the telescope
creates an appearance of convexity which, standing out in relief, conveys the
impression of a spherical mass, but this convexity effect is merely an optical
illusion Flat-Earthers historically have been subject to not only
intense ridicule and ostracism, but many have even been threatened and assaulted
for espousing their beliefs. I have
personally been threatened by Freemasons on multiple occasions for my work
exposing their conspiracies, hoaxes and manipulations. Flat-Earth Society president Charles K. Johnson
claimed a man from NASA attempted to murder him, and later had a massive
suspicious fire that burned his house down, likely the result of arson, which
destroyed his entire Flat-Earth library, all records and contacts of Flat-Earth
Society members. The most renowned
Flat-Earther in modern times, Dr. Samuel Rowbotham, also had his fair share of
violent opposition. For
the long period of thirty-one years I have labored singlehandedly to bring this
important subject before the world: both on the lecture platform and in local
journals, and travelling from place to place - never resting longer than a few
months in one locality, but like a scientific philosophic gypsy breaking up his
tent and pitching it ‘here there and everywhere’ in order to draw this great
question to the attention of all classes and degrees of intelligence. And as matter of course I have had to bear
every possible form of opposition, the bitterest denunciations - often
amounting to threats of violence and personal danger, the foulest
misrepresentations, the most reckless calumny, and the wildest and most
desperate efforts to stay my career and counteract my teachings It has become a duty, paramount and
imperative, to meet them in open, avowed, and unyielding rebellion; to declare
that their unopposed reign of error and confusion is over; and that henceforth,
like a falling dynasty, they must shrink and disappear, leaving the throne and
the kingdom to those awakening intellects whose numbers are constantly
increasing, and whose march is rapid and irresistible. The soldiers of truth and reason have drawn
the sword, and ere another generation has been educated, will have forced the
usurper to abdicate! It may be boldly asked where can the man be found,
possessing the extraordinary gifts of Newton, who could suffer himself to be
deluded by such a hocus-pocus, if he had not in the first instance willfully
deceived himself? Only those who know the strength of self-deception, and the
extent to which it sometimes trenches on dishonesty, are in a condition to
explain the conduct of Newton and of Newton's school. To support his unnatural
theory Newton heaps fiction upon fiction, seeking to dazzle where he cannot
convince. In whatever way or manner may
have occurred this business, I must still say that I curse this modern theory
of Cosmogony, and hope that perchance there may appear, in due time, some young
scientist of genius, who will pick up courage enough to upset this universally
disseminated delirium of lunatics I could easily cite other good authorities to similar effect, but
I think enough have been already given, to show that the absurdities of Modem
Astronomy have not been palmed upon the world without a strong protest from
thoughtful minds, and I sincerely trust that the following pages may prove
useful to some honest thinkers, not only in exposing the fallacies of this
chimerical science, but in showing the true position of the world, as proved by
facts in nature … I sincerely trust that, after considering the evidence which
has been brought before him, the thoughtful Reader will clearly see that this
world of ours is not a Planet, as supposed by our Modem Astronomers, but a real
Terra Firma, founded upon the waters of the Great Deep, from which come and to
which return, with unceasing flow, the rivers of the Earth, in accordance with
the wise and beneficent purpose of our Divine Creator Thus we see that this Newtonian philosophy is devoid of
consistency; its details are the result of an entire violation of the laws of
legitimate reasoning, and all its premises are assumed. It is, in fact, nothing
more than assumption upon assumption, and the conclusions derived therefrom are
willfully considered as things proved, and to be employed as truths to
substantiate the first and fundamental assumptions. Such a ‘juggle and jumble’
of fancies and falsehoods extended and intensified as in theoretical astronomy
is calculated to make the unprejudiced inquirer revolt with horror from the
terrible conjuration which has been practised upon him; to sternly resolve to
resist its further progress; to endeavour to over-throw the entire edifice, and
to bury in its ruins the false honours which have been associated with its fabricators,
and which still attach to its devotees. For the learning, the patience, the
perseverance and devotion for which they have ever been examples, honour and
applause need not be withheld; but their false reasoning, the advantages they

42,The South Pole Does Not Exist!,"Polaris, the North Star, sits straight over
the North Pole at the highest point in the heavens, and like a slowly rotating
planetarium dome all the celestial bodies revolve around Polaris and over the
Earth once per day. The Sun circles over
and around the circumference of Earth every 24 hours, steadily traveling each
day from the equator during the March vernal equinox, up to the Tropic of
Cancer at the June summer solstice, back down to the equator for the September
autumnal equinox, and all the way down to the Tropic of Capricorn on the
December winter solstice. In the Flat-Earth model, the South Pole does not exist at
all and Antarctica is instead a gigantic ice-wall extending the circumference
of Earth holding in the oceans like a giant bowl, or a “world cup.” As strange as this concept may sound at
first, it is a fact that if you set a bearing due South from anywhere on Earth,
inevitably at or before 78 degrees Southern latitude, you will find yourself
face-to-face with an enormous ice-wall towering 100-200 feet in the air
extending to the East and West the entire circumference of the world! The ice-barrier, so frequently referred to in accounts of the
Antarctic regions, is the fore-front of the enormous glacier-covering, or
ice-cap, which, accumulating in vast, undulating fields from the heavy
snowfall, and ultimately attaining hundreds, if not thousands, of feet in
thickness, creeps from the continent of Antarctica into the polar sea. The
ice-barrier, yet a part of the parent ice-cap, presents itself to the navigator
who has boldness enough to approach its fearful front, as a solid, perpendicular
wall of marble-like ice, ranging from one thousand to two thousand feet in
thickness, of which from one hundred to two hundred feet rises above, and from
eight hundred to eighteen hundred feet sinks below, the level of the sea -Greely, General A. W. ""Antarctica, or
the Hypothetical Southern Continent."" Cosmopolitan 17 (1894): p. 296 It has been demonstrated that the earth is a plane, the
surface-centre of which is immediately underneath the star called ‘Polaris,’
and the extremities of which are bounded by a vast region of ice and water and
irregular masses of land. The whole
terminates in fog and darkness, where snow and driving hail, piercing sleet and
boisterous winds, howling storms, madly-mounting waves, and clashing icebergs
are almost constant. Antarctica is not the tiny “ice-continent” found confined to the underside
antipode of astronomer’s globes. Quite
the contrary, Antarctica literally surrounds us 360 degrees, encircles every
continent, and acts as a barrier holding in the oceans. The most commonly asked questions, and the
greatest mysteries yet to be solved are: how far does the Antarctic ice extend
outwards? Thanks to U.N. treaties and
constant military surveillance, the North Pole and Antarctica remain cloaked in
government secrecy, both purported “no-fly/no-sail” zones, with several reports
of civilian pilots and captains being shooed away and escorted back under
threat of violence. How far the ice extends; how it terminates; and what exists
beyond it, are questions to which no present human experience can reply. All we
at present know is, that snow and hail, howling winds, and indescribable storms
and hurricanes prevail; and that in every direction ‘human ingress is barred by
unsealed escarpments of perpetual ice,’ extending farther than eye or telescope
can penetrate, and becoming lost in gloom and darkness Before reaching the Antarctic ice-wall, navigating the
increasingly tumultuous Southern oceans, explorers encounter the longest,
darkest, coldest nights and the most dangerous seas and storms anywhere on Earth. The waves rise like
mountains in height; ships are heaved up to the clouds, and apparently
precipitated by circling whirlpools to the bed of the ocean. The winds are piercing cold, and so
boisterous that the pilot’s voice can seldom be heard, whilst a dismal and
almost continual darkness adds greatly to the danger In 1773 Captain Cook became the first modern explorer known
to have breached the Antarctic Circle and reached the ice barrier. During three voyages, lasting three years and
eight days, Captain Cook and crew sailed a total of 60,000 miles along the
Antarctic coastline never once finding an inlet or path through or beyond the
massive glacial wall! The ice extended east and west far beyond the reach of our sight,
while the southern half of the horizon was illuminated by rays of light which
were reflected from the ice to a considerable height. It was indeed my opinion that this ice
extends quite to the pole, or perhaps joins some land to which it has been
fixed since creation On October 5th, 1839 another explorer, James Clark Ross began a
series of Antarctic voyages lasting a total of 4 years and 5 months. Ross and his crew sailed two heavily armored
warships thousands of miles, losing many men from hurricanes and icebergs, looking
for an entry point beyond the southern glacial wall. It presented an extraordinary appearance, gradually increasing in
height, as we got nearer to it, and proving at length to be a perpendicular
cliff of ice, between one hundred and fifty feet and two hundred feet above the
level of the sea, perfectly flat and level at the top, and without any fissures
or promontories on its even seaward face. We might with equal chance of success try to sail through the cliffs of
Dover, as to penetrate such a mass Yes, but we can circumnavigate the South easily enough,’
is often said by those who don't know, The British Ship Challenger recently
completed the circuit of the Southern region - indirectly, to be sure - but she
was three years about it, and traversed nearly 69,000 miles - a stretch long
enough to have taken her six times round on the globular hypothesis If we now consider the fact that when we travel by land or sea,
and from any part of the known world, in a direction towards the North polar
star, we shall arrive at one and the same point, we are forced to the
conclusion that what has hitherto been called the North Polar region, is really
the center of the Earth. That from this
northern center the land diverges and stretches out, of necessity, towards a
circumference, which must now be called the Southern region: which is a vast
circle, and not a pole or center … In this and other ways all the great
navigators have been frustrated in their efforts, and have been more or less
confounded in their attempts to sail round the Earth upon or beyond the
Antarctic circle. But if the southern
region is a pole or center, like the north, there would be little difficulty in
circumnavigating it, for the distance round would be comparatively small. When it is seen that the Earth is not a
sphere, but a plane, having only one center, the north; and that the south is
the vast icy boundary of the world, the difficulties experienced by
circumnavigators can be easily understood. If the Earth were truly a globe, then every line of latitude
South of the equator would have to measure a gradually smaller and smaller
circumference the farther South traveled. In other words, the circumference at 10 degrees South latitude would
comprise a smaller circle than at the equator, 20 degrees South latitude would
comprise a circle smaller than 10, and so on. If, however, the Earth is an extended plane, then every line of latitude
South of the equator should measure a gradually larger and larger circumference
the farther South traveled. 10 degrees
South latitude will comprise a larger circle than the equator, 20 degrees South
latitude will comprise a circle larger than 10, and so on. Likewise, if the Earth were a globe, lines of
longitude would bubble out at the equator while converging at both poles. Whereas if the Earth is an extended plane,
lines of longitude should simply expand straight outwards from the North Pole. Upon the principle, as taught by Scripture and common
observation, that the world is not a Planet, but consists of vast masses of
land stretched out upon level seas, the North being the centre of the system,
it is evident that the degrees of longitude will gradually increase in width
the whole way from the North centre to the icy boundary of the great Southern
Circumference. In consequence of the difference between the actual extent of
longitudes and that allowed for them by the Nautical Authorities, which
difference, at the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope, has been estimated to
amount to a great number of miles, many Ship-masters have lost their reckoning,
and many vessels have been wrecked. Ship-captains, who have been educated in the
globular theory, know not how to account for their getting so much out of their
course in Southern latitudes, and generally put it down to currents; but this
reason is futile, for although currents may exist, they do not usually run in
opposite directions, and vessels are frequently wrecked, whether sailing East
or West. During Captain James Clark Ross’s voyages around the Antarctic
circumference, he often wrote in his journal perplexed at how they routinely
found themselves out of accordance with their charts, stating that they found
themselves an average of 12-16 miles outside their reckoning every day, some
days as much as 29 miles. Lieutenant
Charles Wilkes commanded a United States Navy exploration expedition to the
Antarctic from August 18th, 1838 to June 10th, 1842, almost four years spent
“exploring and surveying the Southern ocean.” In his journals Lieutenant Wilkes also mentioned being consistently east
of his reckoning, sometimes over 20 miles in less than 18 hours. The commanders of these various expeditions were, of course, with
their education and belief in the earth's rotundity, unable to conceive of any
other cause for the differences between log and chronometer results than the
existence of currents. But one simple fact is entirely fatal to such an
explanation, viz., that when the route taken is east or west the same results
are experienced. The water of the
southern region cannot be running in two opposite directions at the same time;
and hence, although various local and variable currents have been noticed, they
cannot be shown to be the cause of the discrepancies so generally observed in
high southern latitudes between time and log results. The conclusion is one of necessity, forced
upon us by the sum of the evidence collected that the degrees of longitude in
any given southern latitude are larger than the degrees in any latitude nearer
to the northern center; thus proving the already more than sufficiently
demonstrated fact that the earth is a plane, having a northern center, in
relation to which degrees of latitude are concentric, and from which degrees of
longitude are diverging lines, continually increasing in their distance from
each other as they are prolonged towards the great glacial southern
circumference. February 11th, 1822, at noon, in latitude 65.53. S. our
chronometers gave 44 miles more westing than the log in three days. On 22nd of
April (1822), in latitude 54.16. S. our longitude by chronometers was 46.49,
and by D.R. (dead reckoning) 47° 11´: On 2nd May (1822), at noon, in latitude
53.46. S., our longitude by chronometers was 59° 27´, and by D.R. 61° 6´.
October 14th, in latitude 58.6, longitude by chronometers 62° 46´, by account
65° 24´. In latitude 59.7. S., longitude by chronometers was 63° 28´, by
account 66° 42´. In latitude 61.49. S., longitude by chronometers was 61° 53´,
by account 66° 38´. In the southern hemisphere, navigators to India have
often fancied themselves east of the Cape when still west, and have been driven
ashore on the African coast, which, according to their reckoning, lay behind
them. How have so many other noble vessels,
perfectly sound, perfectly manned, perfectly navigated, been wrecked in calm
weather, not only in dark night, or in a fog, but in broad daylight and
sunshine - in the former case upon the coasts, in the latter, upon sunken rocks
- from being ‘out of reckoning,’ under circumstances which until now, have
baffled every satisfactory explanation A nautical mile is the distance, following the supposed curvature of the
Earth, from one minute of latitude to the next. The “Australian Handbook, Almanack, Shippers’ and Importers’
Directory” states that the distance between Sydney and Nelson is 1400 nautical
or 1633 statute miles. Allowing a more
than sufficient 83 miles as the distance for rounding Cape Farewell and sailing
up Tasman Bay to Nelson leaves 1550 statute miles as the straight-line distance
from the meridian of Sydney to the meridian of Nelson. This is larger than the Earth is said to be
at the equator, and 4262 miles greater than it would be at Sydney’s southern
latitude on a globe of said proportions! One 360th part of 25,182 gives 70 miles as the distance between each
degree of longitude at Sydney’s 34 degree Southern latitude. On a globe 25,000 miles in equatorial
circumference, however, degrees of longitude at 34 degrees latitude would be
only 58 miles, a full 12 miles per degree less than reality. This perfectly explains why Ross and other
navigators in the deep South experienced 12+ mile daily discrepancies between
their reckoning and reality, the farther South traveled the farther the
divide. If 143 degrees make 9,000 miles, what will be the distance made by the
whole 360 degrees into which the surface is divided? It must be borne in mind, however, that the above distances are nautical
measure, which, reduced to statute miles, gives the actual distance round the
Southern region at a given latitude as 26,433 statute miles; or nearly 1,500
miles more than the largest circumference ever assigned to the Earth at the
equator Similar calculations made from the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa to
Melbourne, Australia at an average latitude of 35.5 degrees South, have given
an approximate figure of over 25,000 miles, which is again equal to or greater
than the Earth’s supposed greatest circumference at the equator. Calculations from Sydney, Australia to
Wellington, New Zealand at an average of 37.5 degrees South have given an
approximate circumference of 25,500 miles, greater still! According to the ball-Earth theory, the
circumference of the Earth at 37.5 degrees Southern latitude should be only
19,757 statute miles, almost six thousand miles less than such practical
measurements. The above calculations are, as already stated, only
proximate; but as liberal allowances have been made for irregularities of
route, etc., they are sufficiently accurate to prove that the degrees of
longitude, as we proceed south-wards, do not diminish, as they would upon a
globe, but expand or increase, as they must if the earth is a plane; or, in
other words, the farthest point, or greatest latitude south, must have the
greatest circumference and degrees of longitude.” Parallels of latitude only - of all imaginary lines on
the surface of the Earth - are circles, which increase, progressively, from the
northern centre to the southern circumference. The mariner's course in the
direction of any one of these concentric circles is his longitude, the degrees
of which INCREASE to such an extent beyond the equator (going southwards) that
hundreds of vessels have been wrecked because of the false idea created by the
untruthfulness of the charts and the globular theory together, causing the
sailor to be continually getting out of his reckoning. With a map of the Earth
in its true form all difficulty is done away with, and ships may be conducted
anywhere with perfect safety. This, then, is a very important practical proof
that the Earth is not a globe"
43,The Arctic and Antarctic Prove Flat Earth,"If the Earth were truly a globe, the Arctic and Antarctic
polar regions and areas of comparable latitude North and South of the equator
should share similar conditions and characteristics such as comparable
temperatures, seasonal changes, length of daylight, plant and animal life.  In reality, however, the Arctic/Antarctic
regions and areas of comparable latitude North/South of the equator differ
greatly in many ways. If the earth be the globe of popular belief, the same
amount of heat and cold, summer and winter, should be experienced at the same
latitudes North and South of the Equator. 
The same number of plants and animals would be found, and the same
general conditions exist.  That the very
opposite is the case, disproves the globular assumption.  The great contrasts between places at the
same latitudes North and South of the Equator, is a strong argument against the
received doctrine of the rotundity of the earth. Antarctica is by far the coldest place on Earth with an average
annual temperature of approximately -57 degrees Farenheit, and a record low of
-135.8!  The average annual temperature at
the North Pole, however, is a comparatively warm 4 degrees.  Throughout the year, temperatures in the
Antarctic vary less than half the amount at comparable Arctic latitudes.  The Northern Arctic region enjoys moderately
warm summers and manageable winters, whereas the Southern Antarctic region
never even warms enough to melt the perpetual snow and ice. This uniformity of temperature partly accounts for the
great accumulation of ice which is formed not on account of the great severity
of the winter, but because there is practically no summer to melt it.  In the Antarctic there is eternal winter and
snow never melts.  As far north as a man
has travelled he has found reindeer and hare basking in the sun, and country
brilliant with rich flora; within the Antarctic circle no plant is to be found The island of Kerguelen at 49 degrees Southern latitude has
only 18 species of native plants that can survive its hostile climate.  Compare this with the island of Iceland at 65
degrees Northern latitude, 16 degrees further North of the equator than
Kerguelen is South, yet Iceland is home to 870 species of native plants.  On the Isle of Georgia, just 54 degrees
Southern latitude, the same latitude as Canada or England in the North, where
dense forests of various tall trees abound, the infamous Captain Cook wrote
that he was unable to find a single shrub large enough to make a toothpick!  Cook wrote, “ Not a tree was to be
seen.  The lands which lie to the south
are doomed by nature to perpetual frigidness - never to feel the warmth of the
sun’s rays; whose horrible and savage aspect I have not words to describe.  Even marine life is sparse in certain tracts
of vast extent, and the sea-bird is seldom observed flying over such lonely
wastes.  The contrasts between the limits
of organic life in Arctic and Antarctic zones is very remarkable and
significant.  Vegetables and land animals
are found at nearly 80 degrees in the north; while from the parallel of 58
degrees in the south, the lichen, and such-like plants only, clothe the rocks,
and seabirds and the cetaceous tribes alone are seen upon the desolate beaches In the Arctic there are 4 clearly distinguished seasons,
warm summers, and an abundance of plant and animal life, none of which can be
said of the Antarctic.  The Eskimo live
as far North as the 79th parallel, whereas in the South no native man is found
higher than the 56th.  Admiral Ferdinand
von Wrangel, the 19th century Russian Arctic explorer, wrote how in the North,
“ Countless herds of reindeer, elks, black bears, foxes, sable and grey
squirrels fill the upland forests; stone foxes and wolves roam over the low ground;
enormous flights of swans, geese, and ducks arrive in spring, and seek deserts
where they may moult, and build their nests in safety. Eagles, gulls, and owls
pursue their prey along the sea-coast; ptarmigan run in troops among the
bushes; little snipes are busy among the brooks and in the morasses; the social
crows seek the neighbourhood of man's habitations; and when the sun shines in
spring, one may sometimes even hear the cheerful note of the finch, and in
autumn that of the thrush. Beyond the 70th degree of Southern latitude not a
tree meets the eye, wearied with the white waste of snow; forests, woods, even
shrubs have disappeared, and given place to a few lichens and creeping woody
plants, which scantily clothe the indurated soil. Still, in the farthest north,
Nature claims her birthright of beauty; and in the brief and rapid summer she
brings forth numerous flowers and grasses, to bloom for a few days, to be again
blasted by the swiftly-recurring winter. The rapid fervour of an arctic summer
had already (June 1st) converted the snowy waste into luxuriant pasture-ground,
rich in flowers and grass, with almost the same lively appearance as that of an
English meadow. In New Zealand situated at 42 degrees Southern latitude, on
the Winter Solstice the Sun rises at 4:31am and sets at 7:29pm, making the
longest day of the year 14 hours and 58 minutes.  On the Summer Solstice, the New Zealand Sun
rises at 7:29am and sets at 4:31pm, making the shortest day 9 hours and 2
minutes long.  Meanwhile, in England, a
full 10 degrees farther North of the equator than New Zealand lies South, the
longest day is 16 hours and 34 minutes, the shortest day 7 hours and 45 minutes.  Therefore the longest day in New Zealand is 1
hour and 36 minutes shorter than the longest day in England, and the shortest
day in New Zealand is 1 hour and 17 minutes longer than the shortest day in
England. William Swainson, an Englishman who emigrated and became Attorney
General of New Zealand in the mid-19th century lived in both countries for
decades and wrote of their differences, stating, “ The range of temperature
is limited, there being no excess of either heat or cold; compared with the
climate of England, the summer of New Zealand is but very little warmer though
considerably longer.  Even in summer,
people here have no notion of going without fires in the evening; but then,
though the days are very warm and sunny, the nights are always cold. For seven
months last summer, we had not one day that the sun did not shine as
brilliantly as it does in England in the finest day in June; and though it has
more power here, the heat is not nearly so oppressive.  But then there is not the twilight which you
get in England. Here it is light till about eight o'clock, then, in a few
minutes, it becomes too dark to see anything, and the change comes over in
almost no time.  The seasons are the
reverse of those in England. Spring commences in September, summer in December,
autumn in April, and winter in June. The days are an hour shorter at each end
of the day in summer, and an hour longer in the winter than in England In the Flat-Earth model of the cosmos, these
Arctic/Antarctic phenomena are easily accounted for and exactly what would be
expected.  If the Sun circles over and
around the Earth every 24 hours, steadily travelling from Tropic to Tropic
every 6 months, it follows that the Northern, central region would annually receive
far more heat and sunlight than the Southern circumferential region.  Since the Sun must sweep over the larger
Southern region in the same 24 hours it has to pass over the smaller Northern
region, its passage must necessarily be proportionally faster as well.  This is why the Antarctic morning dawn and
evening twilight are very abrupt, whereas in the extreme North twilight
continues for hours after sunset and many midsummer nights the Sun does not set
at all! If the sun is fixed, and the earth revolves underneath
it, the same phenomena would exist at the same distance on each side of the
equator; but such is not the case! What can operate to cause the twilight in
New Zealand to be so much more sudden, or the nights so much colder than in
England? The southern ‘hemisphere’ cannot revolve more rapidly than the northern!
The latitudes are about the same, and the distance round a globe would be the
same at 50° south as at 50° north, and as the whole would revolve once in
twenty-four hours, the surface at the two places would pass underneath the sun
with the same velocity, and the light would approach in the morning, and recede
in the evening in exactly the same manner, yet the very contrary is the fact! … The constant sunlight of the north
develops, with the utmost rapidity, numerous forms of vegetable life, and
furnishes subsistence for millions of living creatures. But in the south, where
the sunlight never dwells, or lingers about a central region, but rapidly
sweeps over sea and land, to complete in twenty-four hours the great circle of
the southern circumference, it has not time to excite and stimulate the
surface; and, therefore, even in comparatively low southern latitudes,
everything wears an aspect of desolation. 
These differences in the north and south could not exist if the earth
were a globe, turning upon axes underneath a non-moving sun. The two
hemispheres would at the same latitudes have the same degree of light and heat,
and the same general phenomena, both in kind and degree. The peculiarities
which are found in the south as compared with the north, are only such as could
exist upon a stationary plane, having a northern centre, concentric with which
is the path of the moving sun Every year the Sun is as long south of the equator as he is north; and if the
Earth were not ‘stretched out’ as it is, in fact, but turned under, as the
Newtonian theory suggests it would certainly get as intensive a share of the
Sun's rays south as north; but the Southern region being, in consequence of the
fact stated, - far more extensive than the region North, the Sun, having to
complete his journey round every twenty-four hours, travels quicker as he goes
further south, from September to December, and his influence has less time in
which to accumulate at any given point. Since, then the facts could not be as
they are if the Earth were a globe, it is a proof that the Earth is not a globe"
44,Who Brought Back the Flat Earth?,"Since late 2014 Google Analytics has shown a drastic
exponential rise in people searching the term “Flat Earth.” The number of pages referencing flat Earth
have also jumped from a meager few thousand results to the current figure of over
21 million all in the space of a year and a half! Alleged ex-NASA insider Matt Boylan calls it is “his movement” and
claims full responsibility himself, Poet and book-collector Paul Michael Bales also
feels he was the one responsible for this resurgence, while many others have
pointed to video-game designer Mark Sargent as being the real catalyst. In this article/video I will show conclusive
proof beyond any reasonable doubt who has actually been the most influential
and responsible for the growth of the modern flat Earth movement. Every time I have publicly contested the claims of these
three individuals, they accuse me of doing so out of “ego,” and say that I am
“creating division in the movement.” First
of all, defending my perspective and exposing flaws in their arguments is done
out of respect for the truth, not my own personal aggrandizement. Secondly, they are all making the exact same
claim as myself, so any amount of “ego” present in my claim is also equally
present in theirs. And lastly, it is my
contention that THEY are the ones creating division in the movement by purposely
mixing truth and lies in typical controlled opposition fashion to muddy the
waters, discredit the message, and deter neophytes from researching further. Please see the evidence we at IFERS have gathered regarding
these individuals and other suspected controlled opposition shills in the flat
Earth movement: The Earth has always been flat and there have always been people who
knew this, spoke about it and wrote about it. Ever since the advent of NASA, however, the flat Earth concept has been
mired in ridicule and nearly disappeared completely from human awareness. No pro-flat Earth books had been published in
approximately 50 years and the only website about the subject was “The Flat
Earth Society” which treated the entire thing like satire and made several
false claims about what flat Earthers actually hold true. Back in 2008, long before Matt Boylan, Paul Michael Bales or
Mark Sargent were anywhere on the scene, I published a book and started a
website called The Atlantean Conspiracy which contained several articles about
the truth of Geocentricity and even quoted Charles Johnson, the former
President of the International Flat Earth Research Society. century flat Earth books,
and though personally still on the fence regarding the shape of the Earth, I
was confident they were correct about the location (or Geocentricity) of Earth,
so I wrote about it. In 2009, after watching Alex Jones interview and praise
several NASA astronauts on his show, I wrote an article and sent a message to
him and his producers about the Moon Landing Hoax and included a link to Samuel
Rowbotham’s flat Earth book for them to read. Alex even mentioned this on-air the next day and called me a
“flat-Earther” who “thinks he’s covering up some Atlantean Conspiracy,” (the
title of my book and website). For the next several years I continued writing
books/articles about various conspiracies and worked on building a huge social
media presence. By making multiple
accounts, adding as many friends/followers as possible, joining and posting to
as many groups and pages as possible, over the course of a few years I began
building up very large followings on Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn, Twitter,
StumbleUpon, PInterest, Tsu and many other sites. To give you an example of their efficacy you
can see here my main Google Plus account currently has over 135 million views and
my secondary one has over 87 million. Meanwhile, at this point, Matt Boylan, Paul Michael Bales, and
Mark Sargent had still yet to make a blip on the internet radar. The first of them to mention flat Earth was
Matt Boylan when he created his “NASA Channel” on YouTube in mid-2011. He made a few decent videos exposing NASA
image fakery, but his channel certainly did not contain many flat Earth
proofs/evidence, and there are more videos of him ranting about Axe deodorant,
hookers on Tinder, his championship sexual prowess, and other irrelevant topics
than there are exposing the flat Earth. In short, anyone visiting his channel would NOT become a flat Earther
and would be more likely turned off from the subject due to his manic ranting
style and lack of factual content. In early 2014 I began writing my book “The Flat Earth
Conspiracy” and came across Paul Michael Bales on Facebook, a recent flat Earth
convert who had been collecting a library of old original flat Earth books and
letters. Hoping to find some good
reference material, I messaged him asking for recommended titles and he told me
a few choice books to check out. The full
extent of our interaction consisted of a short Facebook conversation, yet
curiously after my book was published and the flat Earth movement began
growing, Paul began stating publicly that he was “the Morpheus to my Neo” and
that he “taught me everything I know about the flat Earth.” Matt Boylan also jumped in and had the gall
to say that “my entire book was plagiarized from his information,” which is equally
laughable considering he and “his information” are only mentioned in 2
paragraphs of my 252 page book. Needless
to say, both of their claims are baseless and go to show how desperate they are
to receive credit where it is not due. You can also see from this Google analytics chart that the
Flat Earth keyword had not made any significant change in 2011 since the launch
of Matt’s YouTube channel, nor in late 2012/early 2013 when Paul claims to have
gotten his start. The moment when the
Flat Earth tides shifted and the exponential growth of the movement began was
clearly around and after November 2014, the exact month when I exploded all of my
flat Earth research onto the internet. In November 2014, I published the first
pro-flat Earth book written in 50 years, “The Flat Earth Conspiracy,” I also
published several popular articles on the subject, uploaded the most popular
“Flat Earth Conspiracy” documentary on YouTube, began giving radio interviews,
and soon re-started Charles Johnson’s IFERS (International Flat Earth Research
Society). These simultaneous actions, my
intentional exploding of credible flat Earth information onto the internet all
at once, which I had been preparing for the entire year before, are undoubtedly
the catalyst behind the exponential growth curve seen beginning here. Later on, around March 2015, recent flat Earth convert Mark
Sargent came out of nowhere, began uploading new flat Earth videos every day, uploading
new interviews several times per week, got offered his own radio show, started
being heralded by many as “the King of flat Earth,” and credited with starting
the modern flat Earth revival. At first
I was glad to have him on-board until the cracks began to show and the clear disinformation
campaign began. Mark claimed the Moon
and stars were “holographic projections” maintained by alleged “dome-builders”
who keep us inside a “Truman show” enclosed structure among much other
non-sense. He even lied about me in several
interviews including one where he claimed that I promoted the idea of a
constantly rising flat Earth to account for gravity, when in fact I constantly
expose this false concept as being disinformation. So, in conclusion, not only do I have publicly available
proof of promoting flat Earth before any of these people, but I also have a
much larger following/influence than all of them put together. My International Flat Earth Research Society
receives over 50,000 visitors per month, my YouTube channel currently has 6.2
million views, my website has 8.6 million, both my 200 Proofs Earth is Not a
Spinning Ball and The Atlantean Conspiracy books have received over 1 million
downloads each, just two of my Google Plus accounts have a combined total of over
200 million views! Combine all this with
my reach on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, StumbleUpon, Pinterest etc. and my
long-standing record of diligent activism and it should be obvious who is the
most responsible / influential person in causing the current flat Earth revival. But, of course, if I dare to stand-up for
myself and say so, that’s just my ego causing division in the movement, right?"
45,Earth is Not a Planet,"In the heliocentric model, Earth is just one of 8 “planets” in our “solar
system,” all of which are said to be huge spherical Earth-like habitations or
globular gas giants millions of miles away. 
They claim the Earth under our feet along with these 7 other planets all
revolve concentric circles/ellipses around the Sun - hence the term “heliocentric.”  The previously prevailing “geocentric” model had
placed the Earth as the immovable center of the universe with the Sun, Moon,
stars and “planets” all revolving around us, just as they appear.  In the heliocentric model, however, which would
be more appropriately titled the “Acentric” model, the Sun is only the center
of our “solar system,” while itself supposedly simultaneously revolving 500,000
mph spirals around the “Milky Way galaxy” which itself is constantly shooting
670,000,000 mph away from an alleged “Big Bang” creationary explosion at the
beginning of time! In the geocentric model, the 7 “planets” were known as
“wandering stars,” with the multitude of other stars known as “fixed
stars.”  The wandering stars were so
called because they can be seen meandering their own unique paths around the
heavens while all the other stars remain fixed in their steady group-rotation
around Polaris.  The wandering stars also
happen to be among the brightest in the night sky, and just as heliocentrsits
falsely claim the Moon to be a mere reflector of the Sun’s light, they claim
the bright starlight of these “planets” is merely them reflecting the Sun’s
light back at us!  This has already been
shown to be geometrically impossible, however, as convex bodies do not and
cannot reflect light in this way. In the heliocentric model, the wandering stars are all supposedly
spherical Earth-like places several miles away from us, while
the fixed stars are all allegedly super-distant “suns,” similar to our own, but
several miles away, complete with their own “solar systems” and
accompanying planets, perhaps even populated with sentient alien beings like
ourselves!  NASA’s current “official”
astronomical statistics state that there are upwards of 10 trillion such “planets”
in our “galaxy” alone, and at least 200 billion galaxies in the universe!  Therefore, they claim, Earth is only 1 of
1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or one septillion planets in the universe! Our Modem Astronomers imagine the Stars to be immense
worlds or suns, some of them many thousands of times larger than our own, and
at an enormous distance. Sir Robert Ball, in his ‘Cause of an Ice-Age,’ p. 77,
says of Sirius - that it is ‘a million times as distant from us as the Sun’ -
that is, that it is ninety-two millions of millions of miles from the Earth! It
is thought that Stars are in a more or less advanced state of development, and
that probably some of them may be already inhabited by beings suited to their
spheres. Their distance from us they calculate to be so immense, that,
according to Sir William Herschel, the light from some of them will take a
thousand years to reach this world of ours! Again, these stars are assumed to have positions so far
from the earth that the distance is almost inexpressible; figures, indeed, may
be arranged on paper, but in reading them no practical idea is conveyed to the
mind. Many are said to be so distant that should they fall with the velocity of
light, or above 160,000 miles in a second of time, 600,000,000 of miles per
hour, they would require nearly 2,000,000 of years to reach the earth! Sir
William Herschel, in a paper on ‘The power of telescopes to penetrate into
space ,’ affirms that with his powerful instruments he
discovered brilliant luminaries so far from the earth that the light which they
emitted ‘could not have been less than one million nine hundred thousand years
in its progress!’ The fixed stars are so called, because except for very
long periods, they do not appreciably alter their relative positions; and they
are mere points of light, so small that the most powerful telescopes cannot
magnify them into discs.  Yet they are
supposed to be suns of immense size, removed by the astronomers to immeasurable
distances away from us, for the credit and convenience of their theories NASA even claims to have sent several remote-controlled
flying-telescopes, like the popular “Hubble” camera into outer-space,
transmitting back to Earth pictorial “proof” of the validity of their
model!  These Hubble pictures show that
the wandering stars are all in fact spherical Earth-like planets, just as the
heliocentrists claimed all along!  The
Hubble pictures show that the fixed stars are also in fact distant suns,
trillions of miles away, just as the heliocentrists claimed!  These Hubble pictures and videos, all of which
are indistinguishable from a good photoshop or Hollywood production, completely
confirm for hypnotized heliocentrists the truth of NASA’s claims and the existence
of various celestial phenomena which only NASA and their advanced cameras can
show, like planets, galaxies, black holes, quasars, etc. Using even the most advanced non-NASA telescopes, however, the fixed
and wandering stars appear to be nothing more than tiny dots of multi-colored
light.   It cannot be ascertained whether fixed stars
are actually distant suns, whether wandering stars are actually Earth-like
planets, or whether any of NASA’s claims hold any validity outside of their
alleged pictorial evidence from these supposed remote-controlled flying
space-telescope images!  Outside of NASA,
what evidence do we have that stars are actually distant solar systems?  What evidence do we have that planets are
Earth-like places in space?  They are
certainly interesting and plausible ideas, but there is absolutely no empirical
evidence to support them.  In fact, if
NASA hadn’t implanted such ideas into their heads, very few people would ever
look up at the night sky and assume those little pin-pricks of light were all
Earth-like objects millions of miles away, or suns trillions of miles away,
complete with orbiting planets and moons just like ours!  The only reason people believe wandering
stars are Earth-like planets and fixed stars are distant suns is because of
NASA propaganda. The planets are not solid, opaque masses of matter, as
is believed. They are simply immaterial, luminous and transparent discs. By the aid of the telescope have been discovered in the
starry vault in the celestial fields which light traverses, as in the corallas
of our flowering plants, and in the metallic oxides, almost every gradation of
prismatic colour between the two extremes of refrangibility.  In a cluster near the Southern Cross - red,
green, blue, and bluish green - appear in large telescopes, like gems of many
colours, like a superb piece of fancy jewellery If stars are all distant planets or suns, how is it that various
phenomena have often been observed including stars changing color, intensity of
light, sudden appearance, disappearance, or shooting quickly from one place to
another?  I have watched single stars
changing their colors as regularly as a disco ball, others shooting through the
sky and disappearing, and stranger still, I once saw a star shoot quickly
straight upwards through the sky for two seconds and then stop again! Back in the late 16th century, when the heliocentric theory was
starting to take hold over the imaginations of an unsuspecting public, Danish
Astronomer Tycho Brahe famously argued for geocentricity, positing that if the
Earth revolved in an orbit round the sun, the change in relative position of
the stars after 6 months of orbital motion could not fail to be seen.  The stars should seem to separate as we
approach and come together as we recede.  In actual fact, however, after 190,000,000
miles of supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax can be
detected in the stars! In the time of Tycho Brahe it was said that the earth
revolved around the sun, but he argued that if the earth revolved around the
sun, the relative position of the stars would change very much, and the matter
must, in the nature of the case, be easily detected.  Accordingly, experiments were tried at intervals
of six months, and the result showed that the stars were in exactly the same
position as they had occupied six months before, thus proving that the earth
does not move at all If the earth is at a given point in space on say January
1st, and according to present-day science, at a distance of 190,000,000 miles
from that point six months afterwards, it follows that the relative position
and directions of the stars will have greatly changed, however small the angle
of parallax may be. That this great change is nowhere apparent and has never
been observed incontestably proves that the earth is at rest When Tycho Brahe demonstrated that after 190,000,000 miles
of supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax could be
detected, heliocentrists desperate to patch the glaring hole in their theory,
pushed their hypothetical distances to the stars into the trillions of miles,
claiming the closest one, Proxima Centauri, was a ludicrous 25 trillion miles
away, and thereby making all the stars so conveniently far that no appreciable
parallax could be detected!  This
expedient explanation, which heliocentrists have clung to ever since, has
proven satisfactory to silence the manipulated minds of the masses, but still
fails to adequately account for several issues. It is found by observation that the stars come to the meridian
about four minutes earlier every twenty-four hours than the sun, taking the
solar time as the standard. This makes 120 minutes every thirty days, and
twenty-four hours in the year. Hence all the constellations have passed before
or in advance of the sun in that time. This is the simple fact as observed in
nature, but the theory of rotundity and motion on axes and in an orbit has no
place for it. Visible truth must be ignored, because this theory stands in the
way, and prevents its votaries from understanding it. Considerably more than a million Earths would be
required to make up a body like the Sun -the astronomers tell us: and more than
53,000 suns would be wanted to equal the cubic contents of the star Vega. And
Vega is a ‘small star!’ And there are countless millions of these stars! And it
takes 30,000,000 years for the light of some of those stars to reach us at
12,000,000 miles in a minute! And, says Mr. Proctor, ‘I think a moderate
estimate of the age of the Earth would be 500,000,000 years!’ ‘Its weight,’
says the same individual, ‘is 6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons!’ Now, since
no human being is able to comprehend these things, the giving of them to the
world is an insult - an outrage. And though they have all risen from the one
assumption that Earth is a planet, instead of upholding the assumption, they
drag it down by the weight of their own absurdity, and leave it lying in the
dust - a proof that Earth is not a globe Several experiments have since been performed and repeated by
notable scientists like Albert Michelson, Edward Morley, George Airy, and
Georges Sagnac proving that it is the stars that revolve around a stationary
Earth and not the other way around.  The conclusive
results of their experiments are not contested or even mentioned in modern
astronomy books; rather they are conveniently swept under the carpet to keep
prying minds from seeing through the lies. 
For example, the experiment known as “Airy’s Failure” (since it failed
to prove heliocentricity) involved filling a telescope with water to slow the
speed of light inside.  Usually
telescopes must be slightly tilted to get starlight down the axis of the tube
supposedly due to “Earth's speed around the sun.” Airy discovered that actually
the starlight was already coming in at the correct angle so no change was
necessary. This demonstrated that the stars move relative to a stationary Earth
and not the other way around, because if it was the telescope moving he would
have to change the angle. All the planets, including the sun, revolve round the
earth. These circumstances cannot be denied since they are plainly visible,
either in the ordinary way with the naked eye, or with the help of the
telescope. It can be said, in this connection, that in the case of a science
which should be based exclusively on observation and not on speculation such as
astronomy, the evidence of the senses is the only factor upon which conclusions
can, and must be, based. If the planets can be seen revolving round the earth,
it is for the decisive factor that they do revolve in such a way. It is
asserted that this is not so, and it is maintained that the earth and the
planets revolve round the sun. We note with astonishment, however, the bizarre
and definitely suspicious fact that these planetary movements are not visible.
They cannot be seen and yet they are called real! How then can these movements
be proved and their speed be ascertained since they are invisible? On the other
hand, the existing geocentric planetary motions which can be observed and
measured, and which, consequently, constitute a perfectly valid system, are condemned
as unreal and apparent! A pertinent remark may, incidentally, be made on the
subject. Why do the astronomical tables which are published year after year,
give the so-called apparent movements of the planets in the zodiac? Why take
the trouble of calculating and putting them on record at all if they are not
real? Why is it also that no mention is made of the so-called real movements of
the planets? Trust your eyes and your cameras! They have no reason to
deceive you about whether the stars are going around nightly! Then get it in
your mind: This single fact surrounding star trails that has been photographed
thousands of times and cannot be denied must be explained away by the
Theoretical Science Establishment. All of the factless allegations - a rotating
and orbiting Earth; billions of light year distances to the stars; a 15 billion
year old universe; the whole Big Bang Paradigm; all of the alleged evolution of
the universe, earth, and mankind; that is to say: all of modern evolution-based
cosmology controlling ‘knowledge’ today, all of it, is completely undone if the
stars are doing what cameras show they are doing, namely, going around the
Earth nightly ... If you can do so for a few minutes, just lay aside the
Copernican indoctrination that accompanies such pictures and take a good hard
look at these photographs of something that really, really happens every single
night. Do you see what I see? I see all the visible stars in the northern skies
going around the North Star in perfect circles. In other words, I see all the
stars which these time exposures have recorded actually going around that navigational
star that God put there for us in the Northern Hemisphere.” The plurality of worlds is based on assumptions so contrary to
known possibilities, that the ‘grand idea’ must be thrown into the waste-paper
basket.  The supposed great distance of
the sun from the earth is the main cause of the delusions of the learned as to
the so-called worlds above us being inhabited. 
This distance is based on a fictitious idea, that of the revolution of
the earth round the sun, which I have already shown to be unconditionally
false.  The sun is a small body of light
and near the earth, therefore all the star distances are wrong, their sizes and
all other suppositions.  The plurality of
worlds is only the logical sequence of belief if the earth be a rapidly
revolving globe.  But this has been shown
to be ridiculous in the extreme. 
Evidence, apart from any theory has been presented which entirely
nullifies such an assumption, and renders it absurd; showing that such an
unnatural idea has not a vestige of natural fact to support it.  The grand doctrine of the plurality of
worlds, therefore, like all the other grand doctrines of modern astronomy, must
be consigned to oblivion.  When it can be
shown that this world is a globe and by what known principle the inhabitants
can hang on to the swinging ball, like the house fly crawls along the ceiling,
it will be quite time enough to talk about the plurality of worlds"
46,Sun and Moon Equal Divine Balanced Opposites,"When you look up at the Sun and Moon you see two equally-sized equidistant
circles tracing similar paths at similar speeds around a flat, stationary
Earth. To begin with, they say the Earth is not flat
but a big ball; not stationary but spinning around 19 miles per second; they
say the Sun does not revolve around the Earth as it appears, but Earth revolves
around the Sun; the Moon, on the other hand, does revolve around the Earth,
though not East to West as it appears, rather West to East; and the Sun is
actually 400 times larger than the Moon and 400 times farther away! That’s right, you can clearly see they are
the same size and distance, you can see the Earth is flat, you can feel the
Earth is stationary, but according to the gospel of modern astronomy, you are
wrong and a simpleton worthy of endless ridicule if you dare to believe your own
eyes and experience! With haughty arrogance the nearest hypnotized heliocentrist will then
inform you that the Sun is 865,374 miles in diameter and 92,955,807 miles from
the Earth, the Moon is 2,159 miles in diameter and 238,900 miles from Earth,
and those just happen to be the diameters and distances necessary
for a viewer from Earth to falsely perceive them as being the same size! So, you see, silly Flat-Earther, it is all an
illusion and the apparent equanimity of our day and night luminaries in the sky
results from mere coincidental parallax perspective! The Sun does not revolve around the Earth as
it appears; rather the Earth spins 1,038 mph under your feet and revolves
67,108 mph around the Sun! Though it seems to move East to West just
like the Sun and everything else in the heavens, the Moon actually spins West
to East at 10.3 mph while orbiting Earth at 2,288 mph, which combined with the
Earth’s 1,038mph spin and 67,108 mph orbit around the Sun coincidentally results
in all motions perfectly cancelling out making the Moon seem to move across the
heavens with similar path and similar speed as the Sun while always only
showing us one side of its surface, and perpetually hiding its “dark side.” The Moon presented a special math problem for the
construction of the heliocentricity model. The only way to make the Moon fit in
with the other assumptions was to reverse its direction from that of what everyone
who has ever lived has seen it go. The math model couldn’t just stop the Moon
like it did the Sun, that wouldn’t work. And it couldn’t let it continue to go
East to West as we see it go, either at the same speed or at a different speed.
The only option was to reverse its observed East to West direction and change
its speed from about 64,000 miles an hour to about 2,200 miles an hour. This
reversal, along with the change in speed, were unavoidable assumptions that
needed to be adopted if the model was to have any chance of mimicking reality They want you to believe that the Moon's rotation is perfectly
synchronized with its orbit so that's why we only ever see one side of the
Moon, rather than conclude the obvious - that the Moon is simply NOT rotating.
Moreover, they had to slow down the Moon's speed by 58,870 mph AND reverse its
direction to West-East to successfully sell their phony heliocentricity system
to a gullible public. I don't think there is one person in many, many thousands
- regardless of education - who knows that the Copernican Model had to turn the
Moon's observable direction around and give it a new speed to accommodate the
phases and eclipses. Astronomers tell us that the Moon goes round the Earth
in about 28 days. Well, we may see her making her journey round every day, if
we make use of our eyes and these are about the best things we have to use. The
Moon falls behind in her daily motion as compared with that of the Sun to the
extent of one revolution in the time specified; but that is not making a
revolution. Failing to go as fast as other bodies go in one direction does not
constitute a going round in the opposite one - as the astronomers would have us
believe! And, since all this absurdity has been rendered necessary for no other
purpose than to help other absurdities along, it is clear that the astronomers
are on the wrong track There are several theories about the relative size and distance of
the Sun and Moon all with their points of evidence and points of
contention. Flat-Earthers throughout the
ages have used sextants and plane trigonometry attempting to make such
calculations, usually concluding the Sun and Moon both to be only about 32
miles in diameter and less than a few thousand miles from Earth. Perhaps the least plausible model, certainly
the most exaggerated and imaginative, is the reigning heliocentric theory
claiming the Sun to be a whopping 865,374 miles in diameter, 92,955,807 miles
from the Earth, and the Moon Heliocentrists’ astronomical figures always sound perfectly
precise, but they have historically been notorious for regularly and
drastically changing them to suit their various models. Issac Newton once said, “It matters not whether we reckon it 28 or 54
million miles distant for either would do just as well!” Benjamin Martin calculated between 81 and 82
million miles, Thomas Dilworth claimed 93,726,900 miles, John Hind stated
positively 95,298,260 miles, Benjamin Gould said more than 96 million miles,
and Christian Mayer thought it was more than 104 million! As the sun, according to ‘science’ may be anything from 3 to 104 million
miles away, there is plenty of ‘space’ to choose from. You pay your money - for various astronomical
works - and you take your choice as to what distance you wish the sun to
be. If you are a modest person, go in
for a few millions; but if you wish to be ‘very scientific’ and to be
‘mathematically certain’ of your figures, then I advise you to make your choice
somewhere about a hundred millions. You
will at least have plenty of ‘space’ to retreat into, should the next
calculation be against the figures of your choice. You can always add a few millions to ‘keep up
with the times,’ or take off as many as may be required to adjust the distance
to the ‘very latest’ accurate column of figures. Regiments of figures are paraded with all the learned
jargon for which science is famous, but one might as well look at the changing
clouds in the sky and seek for certainty there, as to expect to get it from the
propounders of modern astronomy. But is
there no means of testing these ever-changing never-stable speculations and
bringing them to the scrutiny of the hard logic of fact? The distance of the sun can be measured with
much precision, the same way as a tree or a house, or church steeple is
measured, by plane triangulation. It is
the principle on which a house is built, a table made or a man-of-war
constructed … The sun is always somewhere between the tropics of Cancer and
Capricorn, a distance admitted to be less than 3,000 miles; how then can the
sun if it be so many thousand miles in diameter, squeeze itself into a space of
about 3,000 miles only? We have
already done that and not one of the wise men we have so often challenged, has
ever attempted to refute the principle on which we measure the sun’s distance …
If the navigator neglects to apply the sun’s semi-diameter to his observation
at sea, he is 16 nautical miles out in calculating the position his ship is in. A minute of arc on the sextant represents a
nautical mile, and if the semi-diameter be 16 miles, the diameter is of course
32 miles. And as measured by the
sextant, the sun’s diameter is 32 minutes of arc, that is 32 nautical miles in
diameter. Measuring with sextants and calculating with plane
trigonometry both the Sun and Moon figure to be only about 32 miles in diameter
and approximately 3,000 miles away. As
shown last chapter, the Moon is actually a semi-transparent luminary and not
the solid, spherical, desert planet that NASA would have us believe. In fact, it is likely that both the Sun and
Moon are not densely physical at all and are simply luminous flat discs able to
pass by/through one another during eclipses. The results of recent research prove that the heavenly
luminaries are not Worlds, but lights, and should cause all men who have been
led to accept as proven Copernicus’ theory of the motions of the Earth, to
reconsider this subject The satellites of the earth are not masses of matter. They are
luminous and transparent discs without substance. The moon, in particular,
conveys the impression of being an ethereal manifestation, and the uncertain
and illusive character which is usually associated with this satellite results
precisely from its immaterial nature. It was recognized from the earliest times
that the satellites of the earth, particularly the sun and the moon, were not
solid, opaque bodies. They were first, until Aristotle, considered to be souls
or spirits, which does not imply a physical nature. To the ancients, they were
simply lights, and they gave the sun and the moon a very apt name. They called
them luminaries. In the Flat-Earth model, the Sun and Moon luminaries revolve around
the Earth once every 24 hours illuminating like spotlights the areas over which
they pass. The Sun’s annual journey from
tropic to tropic, solstice to solstice, is what determines the length and
character of days, nights and seasons. This is why equatorial regions experience almost year-round summer and
heat while higher latitudes North and especially South experience more distinct
seasons with harsh winters. The heliocentric model claims seasons change based on the
ball-Earth’s alleged “axial tilt” and “elliptical orbit” around the Sun. Their flawed current model even places us
closest to the Sun (91,400,000 miles) in January when its actually winter, and
farthest from the Sun (94,500,000 miles) in July when its actually summer
throughout much of the Earth. They say
due to the ball-Earth’s tilt, different places receive different amounts of
direct sunlight and that is what produces the seasonal and temperature
changes. This makes little sense, however,
because if the Sun’s heat travels over ninety million miles to reach the
ball-Earth, how could a slight tilt, a mere few thousand miles maximum, negate
the Sun’s ninety million mile journey, giving us simultaneous tropical summers
and Antarctic winters? The earth is a stretched-out structure, which diverges
from the central north in all directions towards the south. The equator, being midway between the north
center and the southern circumference, divides the course of the sun into north
and south declination. The longest
circle round the world which the sun makes, is when it has reached its greatest
southern declination. In
about three months after the southern extremity of its path has been reached,
the sun makes a circle round the equator. Still pursuing a northerly course as it goes round and above the world,
in another three months the greatest northern declination is reached, when the
sun again begins to go towards the south. In north latitudes, when the sun is going north, it rises earlier each
day, is higher at noon and sets later; while in southern latitudes at the same
time, the sun as a matter of course rises later, reaches a lesser altitude at
noon and sets earlier. In northern
latitudes during the southern summer, say from September to December, the sun
rises later each day, is lower at noon and sets earlier; while in the south he
rises earlier, reaches a higher altitude at noon, and sets later each day. This movement round the earth daily is the
cause of the alternations of day and night; while his northerly and southerly courses
produce the seasons. When the sun is
south of the equator it is summer in the south and winter in the north; and
vice versa. The fact of the alternation
of the seasons flatly contradicts the Newtonian delusion that the earth
revolves in an orbit round the sun. It
is said that summer is caused by the earth being nearest the sun, and winter by
its being farthest from the sun. But if
the reader will follow the argument in any text book he will see that according
to the theory, when the earth is nearest the sun there must be summer in both
northern and southern latitudes; and in like manner when it is farthest from
the sun, it must be winter all over the earth at the same time, because the
whole of the globe-earth would then be farthest from the sun!!! In short, it is
impossible to account for the recurrence of the seasons on the assumption that
the earth is globular and that it revolves in an orbit around the sun The seasons are caused by the Sun’s circuit round the
Earth in a spiral ecliptic. In the Winter Solstice (December 21st), the Sun is
vertical over the Tropic of Capricorn. Looking South from London, he appears to
make a small circuit in the Southern sky, during the same period he is seen to cross
the sky at almost overhead in Cape Town, thus causing Summer in the Southern
Hemisphere. In the Summer Solstice (June 21st), the Sun is vertical over the
Tropic of Cancer, (nearly overhead in London), while looking North from Cape
Town, he appears to make a small circuit in the Northern sky, causing Winter in
the Southern and Summer in the Northern Hemisphere The essential feature of the year is its division into two equal
periods of six months, based first on the predominating length of the days over
that of the nights, and vice versa, conditions which are governed by the
varying hours of sunrise and sunset; and secondly, by the either high or low
height reached by the sun in the heavens at mid-day. The first cycle, during
which the days are longer than the nights and the sun reaches its culminating
point of the year, extends from the spring equinox to the autumn equinox, i.e.
March 21st to September 22nd; and the second cycle during which, inversely, the
duration of the nights exceeds that of the days, and the sun descends to its
lowest point of the year, extends from the autumn equinox to the spring
equinox, i.e. September 23rd to March 20th. These two six-month periods are
also characterized by an opposition of temperature. During the first cycle
which corresponds to spring and summer, the heat gradually rises and falls,
while during the second cycle which comprises autumn and winter, it is the
intensity of the cold which progressively increases and decreases In the Flat-Earth model, the Sun and Moon spotlights are
perpetually hovering over and parallel to the surface of the Earth. From our vantage point, due to the Law of
Perspective, the day/night luminaries appear to rise up the Eastern horizon,
curve peaking high overhead, and then sink below the Western horizon. They do not escape to the underside of the
Flat-Earth as one might imagine, but rather rotate concentric clockwise circles
around the circumference from tropic to tropic. The appearance of rising, peaking and setting is due to the common Law
of Perspective where tall objects appear high overhead when nearby, but at a
distance gradually lower towards the vanishing point. Although the Sun is at all times above and parallel to
the Earth’s surface, he appears to ascend the firmament from morning until
noon, and to descend and sink below the horizon at evening. A flock of
birds, when passing over a flat or marshy country, always appears to descend as
it recedes; and if the flock is extensive, the first bird appears lower, or
nearer to the horizon than the last. Bearing these phenomena
in mind, it will easily be seen how the Sun, although always parallel to the
surface of the Earth, must appear to ascend when approaching, and descend after
leaving the meridian or noon-day position What can be more common than the observation that, standing at
one end of a long row of lamp-posts, those nearest to us seem to be the
highest; and those farthest away the lowest; whilst, as we move along towards
the opposite end of the series, those which we approach seem to get higher, and
those we are leaving behind appear to gradually become lower … It is an
ordinary effect of perspective for an object to appear lower and lower as the
observer goes farther and farther away from it. Let any one try the experiment
of looking at a light-house, church spire, monument, gas lamp, or other
elevated object, from a distance of only a few yards, and notice the angle at
which it is observed. On going farther away, the angle under which it is seen
will diminish, and the object will appear lower and lower as the distance of
the observer increases, until, at a certain point, the line of sight to the
object, and the apparently uprising surface of the earth upon or over which it
stands, will converge to the angle which constitutes the ‘vanishing point’ or
the horizon; beyond which it will be invisible Heliocentrists would have you believe the very opposite of
what every human who has ever walked the Earth has seen with their own
eyes. It is obvious to any child and
sovereign-minded adult that the Sun, Moon, stars and planets, every light in
the sky above, revolves around the motionless Earth beneath our feet. It is also plain to see that the Sun and Moon
are both approximately the same size and situated relatively close to Earth, not
400 times divergent and millions upon millions of miles away. To abandon your senses and every day
experience in favor of such unfounded science-fiction fantasies is a fallacy of
appeal to authority so extreme that it leaves the brain-washed believer
impotent to trust his own natural instincts and forever thereafter chained to
the fantastical explanations of astronomical charlatans. No one ever yet felt or saw the earth careering through space at
the terrific rates it is credited with, but everyone who is not blind can see
the sun move. Cause the globe to rotate
against a lamp on a table, and you will find that the shadow left on the globe
is always parallel to the equator, at whatever angle you may incline the
globe. Further, let the stile be of
sufficient length to allow the shadow to fall on to a flat surface, moving the
globe towards the lamp, and the shadow will be a straight line. If, therefore, the shadow left on the earth
by the sun be a straight line, then undoubtedly the sun is stationary. Drive a stake into the ground in such a
position as to expose it to the sun for the greater part of a day - the whole
day if possible. Mark the end of the
shadow every quarter of an hour, and you will find that the marks form part of
an elongated curve, clearly proving that the sun moves over a stationary earth. The Path of the Sun is Concentric, expanding and
contracting daily for six months alternately. This is easily proved by fixing a
rod, say at noon on the 21st of December, so that, on looking along it, the
line of vision will touch the lower edge of the Sun. This line of sight will
continue for several days pretty much the same, but, on the ninth or tenth day,
it will be found that the rod will have to be moved considerably toward the
zenith, in order to touch the lower edge of the Sun, and every day afterwards
it will have to be raised till the 22nd of June. Then there will be little
change for a few days as before, but day by day afterwards the rod will have to
be lowered till the 21st of December, when the Sun is farthest from the
Northern Centre, and it is dark there. This expansion and contraction of the
Sun's path continues every year, and is termed the Northern and Southern
Declination, and should demonstrate to Modem Astronomers the absurdity of
calling the World a Planet, as it remains stationary while the Sun continues
circling round the heavens"
47,Total Eclipse of the Mind,"Many people think that modern astronomy’s ability to accurately
predict lunar and solar eclipses is a result and proof positive of the
heliocentric theory of the universe.  The
fact of the matter however is that eclipses have been accurately predicted by
cultures worldwide for thousands of years before the “heliocentric ball-Earth”
was even a glimmer in Copernicus’ imagination. 
Ptolemy in the 1st century A.D. accurately predicted eclipses for six
hundred years on the basis of a flat, stationary Earth with equal precision as
anyone living today.  All the way back in
600 B.C. Thales accurately predicted an eclipse which ended the war between the
Medes and Lydians.  Eclipses happen
regularly with precision in 18 year cycles, so regardless of geocentric or
heliocentric, flat or globe Earth cosmologies, eclipses can be accurately
calculated independent of such factors. Those who are unacquainted with the methods of
calculating eclipses and other phenomena, are prone to look upon the
correctness of such calculations as powerful arguments in favour of the
doctrine of the earth's rotundity and the Newtonian philosophy, generally. One
of the most pitiful manifestations of ignorance of the true nature of
theoretical astronomy is the ardent inquiry so often made, ‘How is it possible
for that system to be false, which enables its professors to calculate to a
second of time both solar and lunar eclipses for hundreds of years to come?’
The supposition that such calculations are an essential part of the Newtonian
or any other theory is entirely gratuitous, and exceedingly fallacious and
misleading. Whatever theory is adopted, or if all theories are discarded, the
same calculations can be made The Chaldeans used to predict the eclipses three
thousand years ago; with a degree of accuracy that is only surpassed by seconds
in these days because we have wonderful clocks which they had not. Yet they had
an entirely different theory of the universe than we have. The fact is that
eclipses occur with a certain exact regularity just as Christmas and birthdays
do, every so many years, days and minutes, so that anyone who has the records
of the eclipses of thousands of years can predict them as well as the best
astronomers, without any knowledge of their cause The simplest method of ascertaining any future eclipse is to take
the tables which have been formed during hundreds of years of careful
observation; or each observer may form his own tables by collecting a number of
old almanacks one for each of the last forty years; separate the times of the
eclipses in each year, and arrange them in a tabular form. On looking over the
various items he will soon discover parallel cases, or ‘cycles’ of eclipses;
that is, taking the eclipses in the first year of his table, and examining
those of each succeeding year, he will notice peculiarities in each year's
phenomena; but on arriving to the items of the nineteenth and twentieth years,
he will perceive that some of the eclipses in the earlier part of the table
will have been now repeated--that is to say, the times and characters will be
alike … Tables of the places of the sun and moon, of eclipses, and of kindred
phenomena, have existed for thousands of years, and were formed independently
of each other, by the Chaldean, Babylonian, Egyptian, Hindoo, Chinese, and
other ancient astronomers. Modern science has had nothing to do with these Another assumption and supposed proof of Earth’s shape,
heliocentrists claim that lunar eclipses are caused by the shadow of the
ball-Earth occulting the Moon.  The idea
is that the Sun, Earth, and Moon spheres perfectly align like three billiard
balls in a row so that the Sun’s light casts the Earth’s shadow onto the
Moon.  Unfortunately for heliocentrists,
this explanation is rendered completely invalid due to the fact that lunar
eclipses have happened and continue to happen regularly when both the Sun and
Moon are still visible together above the horizon!  For the Sun’s light to be casting Earth’s
shadow onto the Moon, the three bodies must be aligned in a straight 180 degree
syzygy. The Newtonian hypothesis involves the necessity of the Sun, in
the case of a lunar eclipse, being on the opposite side of a globular earth, to
cast its shadow on the Moon: but, since eclipses of the Moon have taken place
with both the Sun and the Moon above the horizon, it follows that it cannot be
the shadow of the Earth that eclipses the Moon, and that the theory is a
blunder That the eclipsor of the moon is a shadow at all is
assumption--no proof whatever is offered. That the moon receives her light from
the sun, and that therefore her surface is darkened by the earth intercepting
the sun's light, is not proved. It is not proved that the earth moves in an
orbit round the sun, and therefore, by being in different positions,
conjunction of sun, earth, and moon, 'Day some-times occur.’ The contrary has
been clearly proved--that the moon is not eclipsed by a shadow; that she is
self-luminous, and not merely a reflector of solar light, and therefore could
not possibly be obscured or eclipsed by a shadow from any object whatever; and
that the earth is devoid of motion, either on axes or in an orbit through
space. Hence to call that an argument for the earth's rotundity, where every
necessary proposition is only assumed, and in relation to which direct and
practical evidence to the contrary is abundant, is to stultify the judgment and
every other reasoning faculty According to the globular theory, a lunar eclipse occurs
when the sun, earth, and moon are in a direct line; but it is on record that
since about the fifteenth century over fifty eclipses have occurred while both
sun and moon have been visible above the horizon As early as the time of Pliny, there are records of lunar eclipses
happening while both the Sun and Moon are visible in the sky.  The Greenwich Royal Observatory recorded that
“during the lunar eclipses of July 17th, 1590, November 3rd, 1648, June 16th,
1666, and May 26th, 1668 the moon rose eclipsed whilst the sun was still above
the horizon.”  McCulluch’s Geography
recorded that “on September 20th, 1717 and April 20th, 1837 the moon appeared
to rise eclipsed before the sun had set.” 
Sir Henry Holland also noted in his “Recollections of Past Life” the
April 20th, 1837 phenomena where “the moon rose eclipsed before the sun
set.”  The Daily Telegraph recorded it
happening again on January 17th, 1870, then again in July of the same year, and
it continues to happen during lunar eclipses to this day. It is alleged by
the learned that at a lunar eclipse the earth casts a shadow on the moon, by
intercepting the light of the sun.  The
shadow, it is alleged, is circular, and as only a globe can cast a circular
shadow, and as that shadow is cast by the earth, of course the earth is a
globe.  In fact, what better proof could
any reasonable person require?  ‘Powerful
reasoning,’ says the dupe.  Let us
see.  I have already cited a case where
sun and moon have been seen with the moon eclipsed, and as the earth was not
between, or they both could not have been seen, the shadow said to be on the
moon could not possibly have been cast by the earth.  But as refraction is charged with raising the
moon above the horizon, when it is said to be really beneath, and the amount of
refraction made to tally with what would be required to square the matter, let
us see how refraction would act in regard to a shadow.  Refraction can only exist where the object
and the observer are in different densities. 
If a shilling be put in the bottom of a glass and observed there is no
refraction.  Refraction casts the image
of the shilling UPWARDS, but a shadow always downwards.  If a basin be taken and put near a light, so
that the shadow will shorten inwards and DOWNWARDS; but if the rod is allowed
to rest in the basin and water poured in, the rod will appear to be bent
UPWARDS.  This places the matter beyond
dispute and proves that it is out of the range of possibility that the shadow
said to be on the moon could be that of the earth. In an attempt to explain away the inconsistencies in their
theory, heliocentrists usually claim light refraction must be happening on a
scale large enough to account for the phenomena.  George G. Carey in his “Astronomy and
Astronomical Instruments” claims that this is the reason the full moon has
sometimes been seen eclipsed above the horizon before the sunset, due to a
“horizontal refraction of 36 or 37 minutes, generally about 33 minutes, which
is equal to the diameter of the Sun or Moon.” 
Even if this highly-implausible reverse-engineered damage-control
explanation is accepted, it cannot explain how Earth-bound observers are
supposedly able to see 12,000 miles 180 degrees around “the globe.” Even if we admit refraction, and that to the extent seemingly
required to prove that when the eclipsed moon is seen above the horizon, we are
still confronted with a fact which entirely annihilates every theory propounded
to account for the phenomenon.  Taking
the astronomers’ own equation of 8” to the mile, varying inversely as the
square of the distance, for the curvature of the earth, where sun and moon are
both seen at a lunar eclipse, the center of the sun is said to be in a straight
line with the centers of the earth and the moon, each luminary being 90 degrees
from the observer.  This would give about
6,000 miles as the distance of each body from the observer.  Now, what is the curvature in 6,000 miles?  No less than 24,000,000 feet or 4,545
miles.  Therefore, according to the
astronomers own showing an observer would have to get up into space 4,545 miles
before he could see both sun and moon above his horizon at a lunar
eclipse!!!  As lunar eclipses have been
seen from the surface of the earth with sun and moon both above the horizon at
the same time, it is conclusively proved THAT THERE IS NO ‘CURVATURE OF THE
EARTH,’ and, therefore, that the world is a plane, and cannot by any
possibility be globular.  This one proof
alone demolishes forever the fabric of astronomical imagination and popular
credulity."
48,Relativity Does Not Exist!,"Around the turn of the 20th century, in order to save the
dying heliocentric model from the conclusive experiments of Airy, Michelson, Morley,
Gale, Sagnac, Kantor, Nordmeyer and others, Albert Einstein created his Special
Theory of Relativity, a brilliant revision of heliocentricism which in one
philosophical swoop banished the universal aether from scientific study
replacing it with a form of relativism which allowed for heliocentricism and
geocentricism to hold equal merit. If
there is no absolute aetheric medium within which all things exist, then
hypothetically one can postulate complete relativism with regard to the
movement of two objects, such as the Earth and Sun. At the time, the Michelson-Morley and
Michelson-Gale experiments had already long measured and proven the existence
of the aether, but the church of heliocentricism was not to be deterred,
Einstein never tried to refute the experiments scientifically, choosing instead
to object philosophically with his notion of “absolute relativity,” claiming
that all uniform motion is relative and there exists no absolute state of rest
anywhere in the universe. Nowadays, just
like the theory of heliocentricism, Einstein’s theory of relativity is accepted
worldwide as gospel truth, even though he himself admitted geocentricism is
equally justifiable: “The struggle, so violent in the early days of science, between
the views of Ptolemy and Copernicus would then be quite meaningless. Either
coordinate system could be used with equal justification. The two sentences,
'the sun is at rest and the earth moves,' or 'the sun moves and the earth is at
rest,' would simply mean two different conventions concerning two different
coordinate systems. “People need to be aware that there is a range of models
that could explain the observations. For instance, I can construct you a
spherically symmetrical universe with Earth at its center, and you cannot
disprove it based on observations. You can only exclude it on philosophical
grounds. In my view there is absolutely nothing wrong in that. What I want to
bring into the open is the fact that we are using philosophical criteria in
choosing our models. A lot of cosmology tries to hide that.” Einstein’s necessary modification to the heliocentric theory
ultimately resulted in transforming it into the “acentric” theory of the
universe, because the Sun was no longer the center of anything, and all motion
was only relative. Acentrists soon began
postulating that not only is the Earth spinning 1,000 mph and revolving 67,000
mph around the Sun, but the Earth, Sun
and entire solar system as a whole are simultaneously rotating around the Milky
Way galaxy at 500,000 mph! Furthermore,
the entire galaxy, with the Earth, Sun and entire solar system, are also
simultaneously shooting 670,000,000 mph through the universe 
 
 
away from a Big Bang explosion at the beginning of time! The theory of the three [now four] motions of the Earth
and subsequent ‘relativity,’ is the result of trying to cover up one lie by
another. They say that as we whirl in London at the rate of nearly eleven miles
a minute, we are shooting into space around the Sun at nearly twenty miles a
second, and the Sun itself moves around a point in space, at the immense speed
of 150,000,000 miles in a year, pulling our poor Earth with him at the added
speed - the distance that separates us from the Sun - and in this maddening
whirlwind of motions they try to apply Euclid’s spherical trigonometry to
locate distances - which data was intended by Euclid to determine fixed points
only - with the result that they have brought out wild calculations which have
been fostered dogmatically on a gullible World, but are about as infallible as
the utterances of Borgia Most people who accept that the Earth is in motion
believe it is a proven fact. They do not realize that not only has the motion
of the Earth never been proven, but by the constructs of modern physics and
cosmology cannot be proven. Again, even modern cosmology does not claim to be
able to prove that the Earth is in motion. In fact the very best argument for
Earth’s motion is based on pure ‘modesty’ not logic, observation and
experience. If anyone could prove the Earth’s motion, that someone would become
more famous than Einstein, Hawking and others. They may all be fools but even
they would not make such an ignorant claim to proof of Earth’s motions, and
those who do so don’t realize just how ignorant of physics they really are!
Before folks go demonstrating how ignorant they are, they should consider: 1.
The relationship between Mach’s principle and relativity. 2. The relationship
between Gravity and Inertia, and Gravity and Acceleration (and the paradoxes
that exist). 3. Relativity does not claim to prove Earth’s motions, in fact it
‘dictates’ the ridiculous idea that motion cannot be proven period. 4.
Relativity proposes motion, it does not nor can it claim to disprove that the
Earth is the center of the universe! 5. Only those who are ignorant of physics
attempt to make arguments based on weather patterns, ballistic trajectories,
geosynchronous satellites, and Foucault’s pendulums for evidence of Earth’s
motions! For all those ‘geniuses’ out there, not even Einstein would claim such
stupidity When Einstein first introduced his theory of relativity to the
world, he often used the analogy of a wagon rolling along the street as an
illustration. “What we mean by relative
motion,” he stated in a Princeton University lecture, “in a general sense is
perfectly plain to everyone. If we think
of a wagon moving along a street we know that it is possible to speak of the
wagon at rest, and the street in motion, just as well as it is to speak of the
wagon in motion and the street at rest. That would be amusing if we read it in a comic paper,
but when Professor Einstein says it in a lecture at the Princeton University,
we are expected not to laugh; that is the only difference. It is silly, but I
may not dismiss the matter with that remark, and so I will answer quite
seriously that it is only possible for me to speak of the street moving while
the wagon remains still - and to believe it - when I cast away all the
experience of a lifetime and am no
longer able to understand the evidence of my senses; which is insanity … Such
self-deception as this is not reasoning; it is the negation of reason; which is
the faculty of forming correct conclusions from things observed, judged by the
light of experience. It is unworthy of our intelligence and a waste of our
greatest gift; but that introduction serves very well to illustrate the kind of
illusion that lies at the root of Relativity. When he suggested that the street might be moving while the wagon with
its wheels revolving was standing still, he was asking us to imagine that in a
similar manner the earth we stand upon might be moving while the stars that
pass in the night stand still. It is a Case of Appeal, where Einstein appeals
in the name of a convicted Copernican Astronomy against the judgment of
Michelson - Morley, Nordmeyer, physics, fact, experience, observation and
reason On the surface relativity may seem plausible enough,
especially when presented by a charismatic character of Einstein’s caliber, but
is it really so simple and straight-forward? In fact Einstein’s theory of relativity is so complicated and convoluted
that when it first came to the public’s attention, it was said that there were
probably less than a dozen people on Earth capable of understanding it! After Einstein presented his theory to the
Royal Astronomical Society, philanthropist Eugene Higgins offered a prize of
$5,000 for the best explanation of relativity, in essay form, describing it so
the general public could understand what it was all about. Prize winner Mr. L. Bolton himself admitted
that “even when stated in its simplest form, it remains a tough proposition.” Along with Einstein’s denial of the aether and anything
absolute (except the absoluteness of relativity), he had to create a litany of
new terms and ideas, each depending upon another and contributing to support
the whole. For example, Einstein claimed
there was no aether, that time is a fourth spacial dimension, that “infinity”
and “eternity” do not exist, and that light is a material thing. This meant that time must be added to the
three dimensions of length, breadth, and thickness, that “space” be renamed a
“continuum,” and “points” in the “space-time continuum” be renamed to “events.” What we have always known as a ‘point’ in the terms of
Euclid, Einstein calls an ‘event!’ but if words have any meaning a point and an
event are two totally different things; for a point is a mark, a spot or place,
and is only concerned in the consideration of material things; while an event
is an occurrence, it is something that happens. There is as much difference between them as there is between the
sentence ‘This is a barrel of apples,’ and ‘These apples came from New
Zealand.’ While claiming ‘time’ as a
fourth dimension, Einstein explains that ‘by dimension we must understand
merely one of four independent quantities which locate an event in space.’ This is to imply that the other three
dimensions which are in common use are independent quantities, which is not the
case; for length, breadth and thickness are essentially found in combination;
they co-exist in each and every physical thing, so that they are related -
hence they are not independent quantities. It is independent of any one, or all, the
three proportions of material things, it is not in any way related; and
therefore cannot be used as a fourth dimension Einstein’s theory of relativity claims that light is a
material thing which therefore has weight and is subject to gravity. This idea meant starlight could now bend
under its own weight and curve its path based on the distance and mass of
objects along its trajectory, which allowed heliocentrists like Einstein to
claim stars are in reality not where they appear to be, and that with this new
geometry the stars must be moved to much farther away than previously assumed. Consequently the heavenly bodies may be much further away than
they have hitherto been supposed to be, and every method which is based upon
the geometry of Euclid and the triangulation of Hipparchus will fail to
discover the distance to a star; because its real position is no longer known. Wherefore Einstein has invented a new kind of
geometry, in order to calculate the positions of the stars by what is nothing
more or less than metaphysics Einstein’s “Law of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light”
states that light always travels at the same speed, 186,414 miles per second
(671,090,400 miles per hour), but Einstein also claims that gravity causes
light to bend towards massive objects along its trajectory. If a ray of light can be said to bend,
curve, or deviate from its course due to the gravitational pull of masses in
its path, it must by necessity accelerate when approaching and decelerate when
receding from these things. However, if
light can bend under its own weight, or under the law of gravitation, as
Einstein claims it does, than it is not and cannot be absolute. Strangely enough, while Einstein claims that everything
is in motion and nothing is stable, he allows one thing, and one thing only, to
remain outside the realm of relativity, independent of everything else; He
claims that the velocity of light is constant under all circumstances, and
therefore is absolute. This is a blunder
of the first magnitude, but I do not imagine that he fell into it through any
oversight; for it is quite evident that he was driven into this false
position. He was compelled to say that
the velocity of light is constant, because, if he did not his new geometry
would be useless … We are told that light is a material thing, and that a beam
of light is deflected from a straight line by the gravitation of any and every
thing that lies near its course as it passes within their sphere of influence;
and we are further assured that light always maintains a uniform speed of
186,414 miles a second. We have,
however, to remind Professor Einstein that this was determined as the result of
experiments by the physicists - Fizeau, Foucalt, Cornu, Michelson, and Newcomb,
all of which experiments were conducted within the earth’s atmosphere, on
terra-firma. In all these experiments a
ray of light was reflected between two mirrors several miles apart, so that it
had to pass to and fro always through the atmosphere, and it is not to be
supposed that light, or anything else, can travel at the same speed through the
air as it would through the vacuum Einstein supposes space to be. It is not to be supposed that
any material thing travels at no greater speed through a vacuum than it does
through air, which has a certain amount of density or opacity. If anything does not distinguish the
difference between air and a vacuum, then it is not a material thing; it cannot
be matter. On the other hand, anything
that is matter must of necessity make such a distinction, and in that case its
velocity cannot be constant. Conventional wisdom before Einstein’s theory was that light
was not a material thing, that it discharged in a straight line in every
direction from the source, that it could not be influenced by gravity, could
not bend, curve, or be deflected from its course by anything; As Lord Kelvin
said, “Light diverges from a luminous center outwards in all directions.” Its velocity may be affected according to the
density of the medium through which it passes, but this fact simply proves
Einstein’s “Law of the Constancy of the Velocity of Light” is incorrect. The length of the course used by Newcomb in the final
determination of the Velocity of Light was 7.44242 kilometers. If the ray of light had deviated by a
hair’s-breadth from an absolutely straight line, it never could have passed
through the interstices between the very fine teeth of his revolving wheel, or
return precisely to the appointed spot on his sending and receiving mirrors,
which were 3.72121 kilometers apart. The
fact that the ray of light did pass from mirror to mirror, and through the
wheel, proves that it maintained a straight line; hence it is certain that it
was not deflected from its course by the gravitation of the earth between the
two mirrors; wherefore it is obvious that it was not affected by
gravitation. So we find that the very
experiments by which the accepted 186,414 miles per second as the Velocity of
Light was measured - experiments which were carried out with the utmost
painstaking and minute attention to detail - prove that a ray of light is not
influenced by the gravitation of the earth in the slightest degree. Therefore, if those experiments were good
enough to warrant all the world in accepting the ‘Velocity of Light’ they may
be equally well adduced as proof that a ray of light does not bend by its own
weight; and that light is not affected by gravitation. As for Einstein, if you want to believe that
lengths shrink when an object moves, time changes in the process, and its mass
increases, just so you can explain the anomalies of Michelson's experiment,
that's your privilege, but I'd just as soon answer it by saying that mass, time
and length stay the same and the Earth isn't moving, and I'm just as
'scientific' as you for saying so Relativity is clever; but it belongs to the same category as
Newton’s Law of Gravitation and the Kant-Herschell-Laplace Nebular Hypothesis,
in as far as it is a superfine effort of the imagination seeking to maintain an
impossible theory of the universe in defiance of every fact against it."
49,Gravity Does Not Exist!,"If you fill a balloon with helium, a substance lighter than
the nitrogen, oxygen and other elements which compose the air around it, the
balloon will immediately fly upwards.  If
you fill a balloon with hydrogen, a substance even lighter than helium, the
balloon will fly upwards even faster.  If
you blow a dandelion seed out of your hands, a substance just barely heavier
than the air, it will float away and slowly but eventually fall to the
ground.  And if you drop an anvil from your
hands, something much heavier than the air, it will quickly and directly fall straight
to the ground.  Now, this has absolutely
nothing to do with “gravity.”  The fact
that light things rise up and heavy things fall down is simply a natural
property of weight.  That is very
different from “gravity.”  Gravity is a
hypothetical magnetic-like force possessed by large masses which Isaac Newton
needed to help explain the heliocentric theory of the universe. Most people in England have either read, or heard, that
Sir Isaac Newton’s theory of gravitation was originated by his seeing an apple
fall to the earth from a tree in his garden. 
Persons gifted with ordinary common-sense would say that the apple fell
down to the earth because, bulk for bulk, it was heavier than the surrounding
air; but if, instead of the apple, a fluffy feather had been detached from the
tree, a breeze would probably have sent the feather floating away, and the
feather would not reach the earth until the surrounding air became so still
that, by virtue of its own density, the feather would fall to the ground Wilbur Voliva, a famous flat-Earther in the early 20th century, gave
lectures all over America against Newtonian astronomy.  He would begin by walking on stage with a
book, a balloon, a feather and a brick, and ask the audience: “How is it that a
law of gravitation can pull up a toy balloon and cannot put up a brick?  I throw up this book.  Why doesn’t it go on up?  That book went up as far as the force behind
it forced it and it fell because it was heavier than the air and that is the
only reason.  I cut the string of a toy balloon.  It rises, gets to a certain height and then
it begins to settle.  I take this brick
and a feather.  I blow the feather.  Yonder it goes.  Finally, it begins to settle and comes
down.  This brick goes up as far as the
force forces it and then it comes down because it is heavier than the air.  That is all.” Any object which is heavier than the air, and which is
unsupported, has a natural tendency to fall by its own weight. Newton's famous
apple at Woolsthorpe, or any other apple when ripe, loses hold of its stalk,
and, being heavier than the air, drops as a matter of necessity, to the ground,
totally irrespective of any attraction of the Earth. For, if such attraction
existed, why does not the Earth attract the rising smoke which is not nearly so
heavy as the apple? The answer is simple - because the smoke is lighter than
the air, and, therefore, does not fall but ascends. Gravitation is only a
subterfuge, employed by Newton in his attempt to prove that the Earth revolves
round the Sun, and the quicker it is relegated to the tomb of all the Capulets,
the better will it be for all classes of society. The ‘law of gravitation’ is said by the advocates of the
Newtonian system of astronomy, to be the greatest discovery of science, and the
foundation of the whole of modern astronomy. 
If, therefore, it can be shown that gravitation is a pure assumption,
and an imagination of the mind only, that it has no existence outside of the
brains of its expounders and advocates, the whole of the hypotheses of this
modern so-called science fall to the ground as flat as the surface of the
ocean, and this ‘most exact of all sciences,’ this wonderful ‘feat of the
intellect’ becomes at once the most ridiculous superstition and the most
gigantic imposture to which ignorance and credulity could ever be exposed Einstein’s theory of relativity and the entire heliocentric model of
the universe hinges upon Newton’s “law of gravitation.”  Heliocentrists claim that the Sun is the most
massive object in the heavens, more massive even than the Earth, and therefore
the Earth and other planets by “law” are caught up in the Sun’s “gravity” and
forced to orbit perpetual circles/ellipses around it.  They claim that gravity also somehow allows
people, buildings, the oceans, and all of nature to exist on the under-side of
their “ball-Earth” without falling off. Now, even if gravity did exist, why would it cause both planets
to orbit the Sun and people to stick to the Earth?  Gravity should either cause people to float
in suspended circular orbits around the Earth, or it should cause the Earth to
be pulled and crash into the Sun!  What
sort of magic is “gravity” that it can glue people’s feet to the ball-Earth,
while causing Earth itself to revolve ellipses round the Sun?  The two effects are very different yet the
same cause is attributed to both. Take the case of a shot propelled from a cannon.  By the force of the explosion and the
influence of the reputed action of gravitation, the shot forms a parabolic curve,
and finally falls to the earth.  Here we
may ask, why - if the forces are the same, viz., direct impulse and gravitation
- does not the shot form an orbit like that of a planet, and revolve round the
earth?  The Newtonian may reply, because
the impulse which propelled the shot is temporary; and the impulse which
propelled the planet is permanent. 
Precisely so; but why is the impulse permanent in the case of the planet
revolving round the sun?  What is the
cause of this permanence? If the sun is pulling with such power at the earth and all her
sister planets, why do they not fall down upon him? Furthermore, this magnetic-like attraction of massive
objects gravity is purported to have can be found nowhere in the natural world.  There is no example in nature of a massive
sphere or any other shaped-object which by virtue of its mass alone causes
smaller objects to stick to or orbit around it! 
There is nothing on Earth massive enough that it can be shown to cause
even a dust-bunny to stick to or orbit around it!  Try spinning a wet tennis ball or any other spherical
object with smaller things placed on its surface and you will find that
everything falls or flies off, and nothing sticks to or orbits it.  To claim the existence of a physical “law”
without a single practical evidential example is hearsay, not science. That bodies in some instances are seen to approach each
other is a fact; but that their mutual approach is due to an ‘ attraction,’ or
pulling process, on the part of these bodies, is, after all, a mere theory.
Hypotheses may be sometimes admissible, but when they are invented to support
other hypotheses, they are not only to be doubted but discredited and
discarded. The hypothesis of a universal force called Gravitation is based
upon, and was indeed invented with a view to support another hypothesis,
namely, that the earth and sea together make up a vast globe, whirling away
through space, and therefore needing some force or forces to guide it in its
mad career, and so control it as to make it conform to what is called its
annual orbit round the sun! The theory first of all makes the earth to be a
globe; then not a perfect globe, but an oblate spheroid, flattened at the ‘poles’;
then more oblate, until it was in danger of becoming so flattened that it would
be like a cheese; and, passing over minor variations of form, we are finally
told that the earth is pear-shaped, and that the ‘elipsoid has been replaced by
an apoid!’  What shape it may assume next
we cannot tell; it will depend upon the whim or fancy of some astute and
speculating ‘scientist.’ How is it that “gravity” is so strong that it can hold all the oceans,
buildings and people stuck to the under-side of the ball-Earth, but so weak
that it allows birds, bugs, smoke, and balloons to casually evade its grips
completely!?  How is it that “gravity”
holds our bodies clung to the under-side of the ball-Earth, but yet we can
easily raise our legs and arms, walk or jump and feel no such constant downward
pulling force?  How is it that “gravity”
can cause planets to revolve elliptical orbits around a single center of
attraction?  Ellipses by nature require
two foci, and the force of gravitation would have to regularly increase and
decrease to keep planets in constant orbit and prevent pulling them into direct
collision courses! That the sun’s path is an exact circle for only about
four periods in a year, and then of only a few hours - at the equinoxes and
solstices - completely disproves the ‘might have been’ of circular gravitation,
and by consequence, of all gravitation … If the sun were of sufficient power to
retain the earth in its orbit when nearest the sun, when the earth arrived at
that part of its elliptical path farthest from the sun, the attractive force
(unless very greatly increased) would be utterly incapable of preventing the
earth rushing away into space ‘in a right line forever,’ as astronomers say.  On the other hand, it is equally clear that
if the sun’s attraction were just sufficient to keep the earth in its proper
path when farthest from the sun, and thus to prevent it rushing off into space;
the same power of attraction when the earth was nearest the sun would be so
much greater, that (unless the attraction were very greatly diminished) nothing
would prevent the earth rushing towards and being absorbed by the sun, there
being no counterbalancing focus to prevent such a catastrophe!  As astronomy makes no reference to the
increase and diminution of the attractive force of the sun, called gravitation,
for the above necessary purposes, we are again forced to the conclusion that
the great ‘discovery’ of which astronomers are so proud is absolutely non-existent. We are asked by the Newtonian to believe that the action of
gravitation, which we can easily overcome by the slightest exercise of volition
in raising an hand or a foot, is so overwhelmingly violent when we lose our
balance and fall a distance of a few feet, that this force, which is
imperceptible under usual conditions, may, under extraordinary circumstances,
cause the fracture of every limb we possess? 
Common-sense must reject this interpretation.  Gravitation does not furnish a satisfactory
explanation of the phenomena here described, whereas the definition of weight
already given does, for a body seeking in the readiest manner its level of
stability would produce precisely the result experienced.  If the influence which kept us securely
attached to this earth were identical with that which is powerful enough to
disturb a distant planet in its orbit, we should be more immediately conscious
of its masterful presence and potency; whereas this influence is so impotent in
the very spot where it is supposed to be most dominant that we find an
insurmountable difficulty in accepting the idea of its existence. Heliocentrists claim the ball-Earth is perpetually spinning
on its axis at a mind-numbing 1,038 miles per hour, or 19 miles per second, and
somehow people, animals, buildings, oceans, and other surface phenomena can
stick to the under-side of  the spinning
ball without falling or flying off.  Take
a ride on the “Gravitron” at your local amusement park, however, and notice how
the faster it spins, the more you are pushed towards it.  Even if the
centripetal (inward pulling) force of gravity did exist, which it does not, the
centrifugal (outward pushing) force of the ball-Earth’s supposed 19 mile per
second spin would also exist and have to be overcome, yet neither of these
opposing forces have ever been shown to have any existence outside the
imaginations of heliocentric “scientists.” Gravitation is the term now used to ‘explain’ what
common-sense people look upon as inexplicable. 
Globularists say that all orbs in space are globes gravitating towards
each other in proportion to their magnitude and power of attraction - there being
a ‘centripetal’ force (tending towards the center) and a ‘centrifugal’ force
(tending from the center); but how inert matter can set up any automatic force,
and cause one body to gravitate towards another body, has never yet been made
palpable to the senses.  It belongs to
the regions of Metaphysics (‘existing only in thought’). We are not like flies which, by the peculiar
conformation of their feet, can crawl on a ball, but we are human being, who
require a plane surface on which to walk; and how could we be fastened to the
Earth whirling, according to your theory, around the Sun, at the rate of
eighteen miles per second?  The famed law
of Gravitation will not avail, though we are told that we have fifteen pounds
of atmosphere pressing on every square inch of our bodies, but this does not
appear to be particularly logical, for there are many athletes who can leap
nearly their own height, and run a mile race in less than five minutes, which
they could not possibly do were they thus handicapped The attraction of gravitation is said to be stronger at
the surface of the earth than at a distance from it.  Is it so? 
If I spring upwards perpendicularly I cannot with all my might ascend
more than four feet from the ground; but if I jump in a curve with a low
trajectory, keeping my highest elevation about three feet, I might clear at a
bound a space above the earth of about eighteen feet; so that practically I can
overcome the so-called force (pull) at the distance of four feet, in the
proportion of 18 to 4, being the very reverse of what I ought to be able to do
according to the Newtonian hypothesis Newton also theorized and it is now commonly taught that the Earth’s
ocean tides are caused by gravitational lunar attraction.  If the Moon is only 2,160 miles in diameter
and the Earth 8,000 miles, however, using their own math and “law,” it follows
that the Earth is 87 times more massive and therefore the larger object should
attract the smaller to it, and not the other way around.  If the Earth’s greater gravity is what keeps
the Moon in orbit, it is impossible for the Moon’s lesser gravity to supersede
the Earth’s gravity at Earth’s sea-level, where its gravitational attraction
would even further out-trump the Moon’s. 
Not to mention, the velocity and path of the Moon are uniform and should
therefore exert a uniform influence on the Earth’s tides, when in actuality the
Earth’s tides vary greatly.  Furthermore,
if ocean tides are caused by the Moon’s gravitation, how is it that lakes,
ponds, and other smaller bodies of standing water remain outside the Moon’s
grasp, while the gigantic oceans are so effected!? If the moon lifted up the water, it is evident that near the
land, the water would be drawn away and low instead of high tide caused.  Again, the velocity and path of the moon are
uniform, and it follows that if she exerted any influence on the earth, that
influence could only be a uniform influence. 
But the tides are not uniform.  At
Port Natal the rise and fall is about 6 feet, while at Beira, about 600 miles
up the coast, the rise and fall is 26 feet. 
This effectually settles the matter that the moon has no influence on
the tides. Tides are caused by the gentle and gradual rise and fall of the
earth on the bosom of the mighty deep . 
In inland lakes, there are no tides; which also proves that the moon
cannot attract either the earth or water to cause tides.  But the fact that the basin of the lake is on
the earth which rests on the waters of the deep shows that no tides are
possible, as the waters of the lakes together with the earth rise and fall, and
thus the tides at the coast are caused; while there are no tides on waters
unconnected with the sea It is affirmed that the intensity of attraction
increases with proximity, and vice versâ. How, then, when the waters are drawn
up by the moon from their bed, and away from the earth's attraction,--which at
that greater distance from the centre is considerably diminished, while that of
the moon is proportionately increased--is it possible that all the waters acted
on should be prevented leaving the earth and flying away to the moon?  If the moon has power of attraction
sufficient to lift the waters of the earth at all, even a single inch from
their deepest receptacles, where the earth's attraction is much the greater,
there is nothing in the theory of attraction of gravitation to prevent her
taking to herself all the waters which come within her influence. Let the smaller
body once overcome the power of the larger, and the power of the smaller
becomes greater than when it first operated, because the matter acted on is
nearer to it. Proximity is greater, and therefore power is greater … How then
can the waters of the ocean immediately underneath the moon flow towards the
shores, and so cause a flood tide? Water flows, it is said, through the law of
gravity, or attraction of the earth's centre; is it possible then for the moon,
having once overcome the power of the earth, to let go her hold upon the
waters, through the influence of a power which she has conquered, and which
therefore, is less than her own? … The above and other difficulties which exist
in connection with the explanation of the tides afforded by the Newtonian system,
have led many, including Sir Isaac Newton himself, to admit that such
explanation is the least satisfactory portion of the ‘theory of gravitation.’
Thus we have been carried forward by the sheer force of evidence to the
conclusion that the tides of the sea do not arise from the attraction of the
moon, but simply from the rising and falling of the floating earth in the
waters of the ‘great deep.’ That calmness which is found to exist at the bottom
of the great seas could not be possible if the waters were alternately raised
by the moon and pulled down by the earth. Even Sir Isaac Newton himself confessed that the explanation of
the Moon's action on the Tides was the least satisfactory part of his theory of
Gravitation. This theory asserts that the larger object attracts the smaller,
and the mass of the Moon being reckoned as only one-eighth of that of the
Earth, it follows that, if, by the presumed force of Gravitation, the Earth
revolves round the Sun, much more, for the same reason, should the Moon do so
likewise, instead of which that willful orb still continues to go round our
world. Tides vary greatly in height, owing chiefly to the different
configurations of the adjoining lands. At Chepstow it rises to 60 feet, at
Portishead to 50, while at Dublin Bay it is but 1 2, and at Wexford only 5 feet
… That the Earth itself has a slight tremulous motion may be seen in the
movement of the spirit-level, even when fixed as steadily as possible, and that
the sea has a fluctuation may be witnessed by the oscillation of an anchored
ship in the calmest day of summer. By what means the tides are so regularly
affected is at present only conjectured; possibly it may be by atmospheric pressure
on the waters of the Great Deep, and perhaps even the Moon itself, as suggested
by the late Dr. Rowbotham, may influence the atmosphere, increasing or
diminishing its barometric pressure, and indirectly the rise and fall of the
Earth in the waters Bearing this fact in mind, that there exists a continual
pressure of the atmosphere upon the Earth, and associating it with the fact
that the Earth is a vast plane ‘stretched out upon the waters,’ and it will be
seen that it must of necessity slightly fluctuate, or slowly rise and fall in
the water.  As by the action of the
atmosphere the Earth is slowly depressed, the water moves towards the receding
shore and produces the flood tide; and when by the reaction of the resisting
oceanic medium the Earth gradually ascends the waters recede, and the ebb tide
is produced.  This is the general cause
of tides.  Whatever peculiarities are
observable they may be traced to the reaction of channels, bays, headlands, and
other local causes … That the Earth has a vibratory or tremulous motion, such
as must necessarily belong to a floating and fluctuating structure, is
abundantly proved by the experience of astronomers and surveyors.  If a delicate spirit-level be firmly placed
upon a rock or upon the most solid foundation which it is possible to
construct, the very curious phenomenon will be observed of constant change in
the position of the air-bubble.  However
carefully the ‘level’ may be adjusted, and the instrument protected from the
atmosphere, the ‘bubble’ will not maintain its position many seconds
together.  A somewhat similar influence
has been noticed in astronomical observatories, where instruments of the best
construction and placed in the most approved positions cannot always be relied
upon without occasional re-adjustment In the past several decades, NASA has shown video of astronauts,
supposedly in low-Earth orbit, experiencing complete weightlessness, or “zero gravity,”
how is this weightless effect achieved if gravity doesn’t exist?  As it turns out, for the past several
decades, NASA together with Boeing have been perfecting so-called “Zero G
planes” and “Zero G maneuvers,” which are able to produce weightlessness at any
altitude.  Aboard modified Boeing 727’s
specially trained pilots perform aerobatic maneuvers known as parabolas.  Planes climb with a pitch angle of 45 degrees
using engine thrust and elevator controls, then when maximum height is reached
the craft is pointed downward at high speed. 
The period of weightlessness begins while ascending and lasts all the
way up and over the parabola until reaching a downward pitch angle of 30
degrees, at which point the maneuver is repeated.  Therefore all NASA’s footage of astronauts
aboard “space shuttles,” or “the International Space Station” can be easily
hoaxed and simulated in Earth-atmosphere aboard a Zero G plane.  In fact, watching footage of Zero G plane
flights alongside footage of NASA astronauts supposedly floating around their
“space shuttles” and “space stations,” no observable difference can be seen
between the two. Astronomers claim to have measured all the planets
distances, shapes, orbits, weights, relative positions, and times of revolution
all based on the “law of gravitation” and without gravity, their entire
cosmology folds under its own weight.  Without
gravity, people cannot stand upside-down on a ball-Earth! Without gravity, the
Earth and planets cannot be revolving around the Sun!  Without Newtonian gravitation, Einsteinian relativity,
Copernican heliocentricity, and the entire Big Bang ball-Earth mythos cannot
exist and falls to pieces.  Gravity, both
metaphorically and quite literally, just does not hold any water; not as a
sound theory of cosmology, and not as a law supposedly Man's experience tells him that he is not constructed like the
flies that can live and move upon the ceiling of a room with as much safety as
on the floor: - and since the modern theory of a planetary earth necessitates a
crowd of theories to keep company with it, and one of them is that men are
really bound to the earth by a force which fastens them to it ‘like needles
round a spherical loadstone,’ a theory perfectly outrageous and opposed to all
human experience, it follows that, unless we can trample upon common sense and
ignore the teachings of experience, we have an evident proof that the Earth is
not a globe … If we could - after our minds had once been opened to the light
of Truth - conceive of a globular body on the surface of which human beings
could exist, the power - no matter by what name it be called - that would hold
them on would, then, necessarily, have to be so constraining and cogent that
they could not live; the waters of the oceans would have to be as a solid mass,
for motion would be impossible. But we not only exist, but live and move; and
the water of the ocean skips and dances like a thing of life and beauty! This
is a proof that the Earth is not a globe Nearly a hundred years ago Kepler had suggested that
some kind of unknown force must hold the earth and the heavenly bodies in their
places, and now Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest mathematician of his age, took
up the idea and built the Law of Gravitation. The name is derived from the
Latin word ‘gravis,’ which means ‘heavy,’ ‘ having weight,’ while the Law of
Gravitation is defined as ‘That mutual action between masses of matter by
virtue of which every such mass tends toward every other with a force varying
directly as the product of the masses, and inversely as the square of their
distances apart.’  Reduced to simplicity,
gravitation is said to be ‘That which attracts every thing toward every other
thing.’ That does not tell us much ; and yet the little it does tell us is not
true; for a thoughtful observer knows very well that every thing is not
attracted towards every other thing . . . The definition implies that it is a
force; but it does not say so, for that phrase ‘mutual action ‘ is ambiguous,
and not at all convincing The system of gravitation which makes the sun the moving
centre of the Universe, the awkward principles of which are anything but certain
since they apply to invisible circumstances so that they cannot be checked, is
here replaced by the old geocentric system, universally accepted until the 17th
century in view, of course, of its undisputable obviousness, and in which the
earth, in a state of immobility and surrounded by the planets visibly moving
round it including the sun, is at the centre of our Universe. These two facts
which explain almost everything are firstly, the positive existence above the
earth of a solid dome constituting the sky; and secondly, the non-material
nature of the planets and constellations, which are not physical masses, but
merely luminous manifestations without substance. These are the two
circumstances which lead today to the fundamental transformation of astronomy The theory that motions are produced through material
attraction is absurd.  Attributing such a
power to mere matter, which is passive by nature, is a supreme illusion.  It is a lovely and easy theory to satisfy any
man’s mind, but when the practical test comes, it falls all to pieces and
becomes one of the most ridiculous theories to common sense and judgment"
50,Debunking the Spinning Ball Earth,"One of heliocentrist’s favorite “proofs” of their ball-Earth
theory is the ability for ships and planes to circumnavigate, to sail or fly at
right angles to the North Pole and eventually return to their original location. Since the North Pole and Antarctica are covered
in ice and guarded “no-fly” zones, however, no ships or planes have ever been
known to circumnavigate the Earth in North/South directions, only East/West;
And herein lies the rub, East or West-bound circumnavigation can just as easily
be performed on a flat plane as it can a globular sphere. Just as a compass can place its center-point
on a flat piece of paper and trace a circle either way around the “pole,” so
can a ship or plane circumnavigate a flat-Earth. The only kind of circumnavigation which could
not happen on a flat-Earth is North/South-bound, which is likely the very
reason for the heavily-enforced flight restrictions. Flight restrictions originating from none
other than the United Nations, the same United Nations which haughtily uses a
flat-Earth map as its 
 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 
 
official logo and flag! Circular sailing no more proves the world to be a globe than an
equilateral triangle. The sailing round the world would, of course, take very
much longer, but, in principle, it is exactly the same as that of the yachtsman
circumnavigating the Isle of Wight. Let me give a simple illustration. A boy
wants to sail his iron toy boat by a magnet, so he gets a basin, in the middle
of which he places a soap-dish, or anything else which he may think suitable to
represent the Earth, and then fills the basin with water to display the sea. He
puts in his boat and draws it by the magnet round his little world. But the
boat never passes over the rim to sail under the basin, as if that were
globular, instead of being simply circular. So is it in this world of ours;
from the extreme South we can sail from East to West or from West to East
around it, but we cannot sail from North to South or from South to North, for
we cannot break through intervening lands, nor pass the impenetrable ramparts
of ice and rocks which enclose the great Southern Circumference A very good illustration of the circum-navigation of a
plane will be seen by taking a round table, and fixing a pin in the centre to
represent the magnetic pole. To this central pin attach a string drawn out to
any distance towards the edge of the table. This string may represent the
meridian of Greenwich, extending due north and south. If now a pencil or other
object is placed across, or at right angles to the string, at any distance
between the centre and the circumference of the table, it will represent a
vessel standing due east and west. Now move the pencil and the string together
in either direction, and it will be seen that by keeping the vessel (or
pencil), square to the string it must of necessity describe a circle round the
magnetic centre and return to the starting point in the opposite direction to
that in which it first sailed This is indeed a
logical modus ponens statement, but the conclusion is rendered invalid because
the first premise - that only a globe can be circumnavigated - is categorically
false. Again, the logical conclusion is rendered
invalid and the argument unsound because the first premise is incorrect. The same effect would be experienced on a
stationary flat-Earth as it would on a spinning ball-Earth. The gaining and losing of time on sailing ‘round the
world’ east and west, is generally referred to as another proof of the earth's
rotundity. But it is equally as fallacious as the argument drawn from
circumnavigation, and from the same cause, namely, the assumption that on a
globe only will such a result occur. It will be seen by reference to the following
diagram, that such an effect must arise equally upon a plane as upon a globe. Let V, represent a vessel on the meridian of
Greenwich V, N; and ready to start on a voyage eastward; and S, represent the
sun moving in an opposite direction, or westward. It is evident that the vessel
and the sun being on the same meridian on a given day, if the ship should be
stationary the sun would go round in the direction of the arrows, and would
meet it again in 24 hours. But if, during the next 24 hours, the ship has
sailed to the position X, say 45 degrees of longitude eastward, the sun in its
course would meet it three hours earlier than before, or in 21 hours--because
15 degrees of longitude correspond to one hour of time. Hence three hours would
be gained. The next day, while the sun is going its round the vessel will have
arrived at Y, meeting it 6 hours sooner than it would have done had it remained
at V, and, in the same way, continuing its course eastward, the vessel would at
length meet the sun at Z, twelve hours earlier than if it had remained at V;
and thus passing successively over the arcs 1, 2, and 3, to V, or the starting
point, 24 hours, or one day will have been gained. But the contrary follows if
the ship sails in the opposite direction. The sun having to come round to the
meridian of Greenwich V, S, N, in 24 hours, and the ship having in that time
moved on to the position fig. 3, will have to overtake the ship at that
position, and thus be three hours longer in reaching it. In this way the sun is
more and more behind the meridian time of the ship as it proceeds day after day
upon its westerly course, so that on completing the circum-navigation the
ship's time is one day later than the solar time, reckoning to and from the
meridian of Greenwich. The Sun, as he travels round over the surface of the
Earth, brings ‘noon’ to all places on the successive meridians which he
crosses: his journey being made in a westerly direction, places east of the
Sun's position have had their noon, whilst places to the west of the Sun's
position have still to get it. Therefore, if we travel easterly, we arrive at
those parts of the Earth where ‘time’ is more advanced, the watch in our pocket
has to be ‘put on’ or we may be said to ‘gain time.’ If, on the other hand, we
travel westerly, we arrive at places where it is still ‘morning,’ the watch has
to be ‘put back,’ and it may be said that we ‘lose time.’ But, if we travel
easterly so as to cross the 180th meridian, there is a loss, there, of a day,
which will neutralize the gain of a whole circumnavigation; and, if we travel
westerly, and cross the same meridian, we experience the gain of a day, which
will compensate for the loss during a complete circumnavigation in that
direction. The fact of losing or gaining time in sailing round the world, then,
instead of being evidence of the Earth's ‘rotundity,’ as it is imagined to be,
is, in its practical exemplification, an everlasting proof that the Earth is
not a globe Another favorite “proof” of ball-Earthers is the appearance from an
observer on shore of ships’ hulls being obfuscated by the water and
disappearing from view when sailing away towards the horizon. Their claim is that ship’s hulls disappear
before their mast-heads because the ship is beginning its declination around
the convex curvature of the ball-Earth. Once again, however, their hasty conclusion is drawn from a faulty
premise, namely that only on a ball-Earth can this phenomenon occur. The fact of the matter is that the Law of
Perspective on plane surfaces dictates and necessitates the exact same
occurrence. For example a girl wearing a
dress walking away towards the horizon will appear to sink into the Earth the
farther away she walks. Her feet will
disappear from view first and the distance between the ground and the bottom of
her dress will gradually diminish until after about half a mile it seems like
her dress is touching the ground as she walks on invisible legs. The same happens with cars speeding away, the
axles gradually get lower and the wheels vanish until it appears as if the car
is gliding along its body. Such is the
case on plane surfaces, the lowest parts of objects receding from a given point
of observation necessarily disappear before the highest. This law of Perspective meets us on every hand; and
cannot be gainsaid. If, in a straight line, we look at a frozen lake from a
certain distance, we shall observe people who appear to be skating on their
knees, but, if we approach sufficiently near, we shall see them performing
graceful motions on their feet. Farther, if we look through a straight tunnel,
we shall notice that the roof and the roadway below converge to a point of
light at the end. It is the same law which makes the hills sink, to the
horizon, as the observer recedes, which explains how the ship's hull disappears
in the offing. I would also remark that when the sea is undisturbed by waves,
the hull can be restored to sight by the aid of a good telescope long after it
has disappeared from the naked eye, thus proving that the ship had not gone
down behind the watery hill of a convex globe, but is still sailing on the
level of a Plane sea Not only is the disappearance of ship’s hulls explained by
the Law of Perspective, it is proven undeniably true with the aid of a good
telescope. If you watch a ship sailing
away into the horizon with the naked eye until its hull has completely
disappeared from view under the supposed “curvature of the Earth,” then look
through a telescope, you will notice the entire ship quickly zooms back into
view, hull and all, proving that the disappearance was caused by the Law of
Perspective, and not by a wall of curved water! On any frozen lake or canal, notably on the ‘Bedford
Canal,’ in the county of Cambridge, in winter and on a clear day, skaters may
be observed several miles away, seeming to glide along upon limbs without
feet--skates and boots quite invisible to the unaided eye, but distinctly
visible through a good telescope. But even on the sea, when the water is very
calm, if a vessel is observed until it is just ‘hull down,’ a powerful
telescope turned upon it will restore the hull to sight. From which it must be
concluded that the lower part of a receding ship disappears through the
influence of perspective, and not from sinking behind the summit of a convex
surface Ball-Earthers will often quip that “if the Earth were flat,
then we could see all over it!” but this is of course ignorant and inaccurate. If you stand on the beach, a plain or
prairie, you will find the horizon extends about three to six miles around you
depending on the weather and your eyesight. The range of the human eye, our field of vision is from 110 to 1 degree,
and the smallest angle under which an object can still be seen is 1/60 of 1
degree, so that when an object is 3000 times its own diameter away from an
observer, it will cease to be visible. So for example, the farthest distance at which one can see a 1 inch
diameter penny, is 3000 inches, or 250 feet. Therefore, if a ship’s hull is 10 feet above the water, it will
disappear from the unaided eye at 3000 times 10 feet, or 6 miles. This has nothing to do with the supposed
“convexity” or “curvature” of the Earth and everything to do with the 
 
 
common Law of Perspective. The horizon of an observer is distant or near according
to the greatness or otherwise of his elevation above the surface of the
supposed globe. If he stands 24 feet
above sea level, he is said to be in the center of a circle which bounds his
vision, the radius of which in any direction, on a clear day, is six
miles. A local gentleman tells me that
he has watched a boat-race in New Zealand, seeing the boats all the way out and
home, the distance being 9 miles from where he was standing on the beach. I have seen the hull of a steamer with the
naked eye at an elevation of not more than 24 feet, at a distance of 12 miles,
and in taking observations along the South African coast, have sometimes had an
horizon of at least 20 miles at an elevation of 20 feet only. The distance of the horizon, or vanishing
point, where the sky appears to touch the earth and sea, is determined, largely
by the weather, and when that is clear, by the power of our vision. This is proved by the fact that the telescope
will increase the distance of the horizon very greatly, and bring objects into
view which are entirely beyond the range of vision of the unaided eye. But, as no telescope can pierce a segment of
water, the legitimate conclusion we are forced to arrive at, is that the
surface of water is level, and that, therefore, the shape of the world cannot
be globular, and on such a flat or level surface, the greater the elevation of
the observer, the longer will his range of vision be, and thus the farther he
can see On the shore near Waterloo, a few miles to the north of
Liverpool, a good telescope was fixed, at an elevation of 6 feet above the
water. It was directed to a large steamer, just leaving the River Mersey, and
sailing out to Dublin. Gradually the mast-head of the receding vessel came
nearer to the horizon, until, at length, after more than four hours had
elapsed, it disappeared. The ordinary rate of sailing of the Dublin steamers
was fully eight miles an hour; so that the vessel would be, at least,
thirty-two miles distant when the mast-head came to the horizon. The 6 feet of
elevation of the telescope would require three miles to be deducted for
convexity, which would leave twenty-nine miles, the square of which, multiplied
by 8 inches, gives 560 feet; deducting 80 feet for the height of the main-mast,
and we find that, according to the doctrine of rotundity, the mast-head of the
outward bound steamer should have been 480 feet below the horizon. Many other
experiments of this kind have been made upon sea-going steamers, and always
with results entirely incompatible with the theory that the earth is a globe In the mid 19th century a Frenchman named Léon Foucault
became famous for swinging pendulums and claiming their consequent motions were
proof of the Earth’s diurnal rotation. Since then “Foucault Pendulums” have regularly been swinging at museums
and exposition halls worldwide purporting to provide everlasting perpetual
proof of the heliocentric spinning ball-Earth theory. The truth is, however, unbeknownst to most of
the duped public, that Foucault’s pendulum is a failed experiment which proves
nothing but how easy it is for pseudo-science to deceive the malleable masses. This pendulum, modern scientists tell us, affords a
visible proof that we are living on a whirling globe, which, according to a
‘work on science’ now before me, is spinning upon its so-called axis at the
rate of over 1,000 miles an hour at the equator; and, in addition to other
motions, is rushing on an everlasting tour round the sun (the diameter of which
is said to be 813,000 miles, and its weight 354,936 times greater than the
earth from which it is said to be about 93,000,000 miles distant,) at the rate
of over 1,000 miles per minute. Now to
prove that the earth really has these motions a pendulum is suspended at the
show; the showman sets motion, and bids the gaping world of thoughtless men and
women to ‘behold a proof’ that we are living on a whirling globe which is
rushing away through space! Astronomers have made experiments with pendulums which
have been suspended from the interior of high buildings, and have exulted over
the idea of being able to prove the rotation of the Earth on its ‘axis,’ by the
varying direction taken by the pendulum over a prepared table underneath -
asserting that the table moved round under the pendulum, instead of the
pendulum shifting and oscillating in different directions over the table! But,
since it has been found that, as often as not, the pendulum went round the
wrong way for the ‘rotation’ theory, chagrin has taken the place of exultation,
and we have a proof of the failure of astronomers in their efforts to
substantiate their theory Sometimes they
rotate clockwise and sometimes counter-clockwise, sometimes they fail to rotate
and sometimes they rotate far too much. Scientists who have repeated variations of the experiment have conceded
time and again that “it was difficult to avoid giving the pendulum some slight
lateral bias at starting.” The behavior
of the pendulum actually depends on 1) the initial force beginning its swing
and, 2) the ball-and-socket joint used which most-readily facilitates circular
motion over any other. The supposed
rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the
pendulum’s swing. If the alleged
constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should
be no need to manually start pendulums in motion! If the Earth’s diurnal rotation caused the
360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a
stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth! First, when a pendulum, constructed according to the
plan of M. Foucault, is allowed to vibrate, its plane of vibration is often
variable - not always. The variation
when it does occur, is not uniform - is not always the same in the same place;
nor always the same either in its rate or velocity, or in its direction. It cannot therefore be taken as evidence; for
that which is inconstant cannot be used in favor of or against any given
proposition. Secondly,
if the plane of vibration is observed to change, where is the connection
between such change and the supposed motion of the Earth? What principle of reasoning guides the
experimenter to the conclusion that it is the Earth which moves underneath the
pendulum, and not the pendulum which moves over the Earth? Thirdly, why was not the peculiar arrangement of the point of suspension
of the pendulum specially considered, in regard to its possible influence upon
the plane of oscillation? Was it not
known, or was it overlooked, or was it, in the climax of theoretical revelry,
ignored that a ‘ball-and-socket’ joint is one which facilitates circular motion
more readily than any other? We believe, with all due deference to the pendulum, and its
proprietor, that it proves nothing but the craftiness of the inventor; and we
can only describe the show and showman as deceptions. A thing so childish as this ‘pendulum proof’
that it can only be described as one of the most simple and ridiculous attempts
to gull the public that has ever been conceived. It has been said that the
pendulum experiment proves the rotation of the earth, but this is quite
impossible, for one pendulum turns one way; and sometimes, another pendulum
turns in the opposite direction. Now we
ask does the earth rotate in opposite directions at different places at one and
the same time? Perhaps the experimenters will
kindly enlighten us on this point … If the earth had the terrible motions
attributed to it, there would be some sensible effects of such motions. And how people can stand
watching the pendulum vibrate, and think that they are seeing a proof of the
motions of the earth, almost passes comprehension. They are, however, brought up to believe it,
and it is thought to be ‘scientific’ to believe what the astronomers teach. Also in the mid-19th century, another Frenchman named
Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis performed several experiments showing the effect of
kinetic energy on rotating systems, which have ever since become mythologized
as proof of the heliocentric theory. The
“Coriolis Effect” is often said to cause sinks and toilet bowls in the Northern
Hemisphere to drain spinning in one direction while in the Southern Hemisphere causing
them to spin the opposite way, thus providing proof of the spinning ball-Earth. Once again, however, just like Foucault’s
Pendulums spinning either which way, sinks and toilets in the Northern and Southern
Hemispheres do not consistently spin in any one direction! Sinks and toilets in the very same household
are often found to spin opposite directions, depending entirely upon the shape
of the basin and the angle of the water’s entry, 
 
 
not the supposed rotation of the Earth. While the premise makes sense - that the earth’s
eastward spin would cause the water in a toilet bowl to spin as well - in
reality, the force and speed at which the water enters and leaves the
receptacle is much too great to be influenced by something as miniscule as a
single, 360-degree turn over the span of a day. When all is said and done, the Coriolis effect plays no larger role in toilet
flushes than it does in the revolution of CDs in your stereo. The things that really determine the
direction in which water leaves your toilet or sink are the shape of the bowl
and the angle at which the liquid initially enters that bowl The Coriolis Effect is also said to affect bullet trajectories and
weather patterns as well, supposedly causing most storms in the Northern
Hemisphere to rotate counter-clockwise, and most storms in the Southern
Hemisphere to rotate clockwise, to cause bullets from long range guns to tend
towards the right of the target in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in
the Southern Hemisphere. Not every
bullet and not every storm consistently displays the behavior and therefore
cannot reasonably be used as proof of anything. What about the precision of the
sight aperture, human error, and wind? If some
storms rotate clockwise in the North and counter-clockwise in the South, how do
those storms escape the Coriolis force? And if the entire Earth’s spin is uniform, why should the two
hemispheres be affected any differently? Coriolis’s Effect and Foucault’s Pendulum are both said to prove the
Earth moves beneath our feet, but in reality only prove how easy it can be for
wolves in sheep’s clothing to pull the wool over our eyes."
51,Eric Dubay and IFERS Banned From the Internet,"The enemies of truth have decided to start off the new year with a bang by completely shutting down, without warning or reason, the International Flat Earth Research Society forum.  In just 10 months we accumulated over 3,000 members and averaged over 50,000 visitors per month which was apparently too much flat Earth truth for the internet to handle.  According to Proboards section 25a, they claim the right to ""shut down any forum for any reason at any time"" which they enforced without a word to myself or the other admins on new years eve. This was not the first act of censorship by Proboards as well.  A few months ago they also threatened to delete our entire forum if we didn't remove within 48 hours the thread for my documentary Adolf Hitler vs. The Jew World Order claiming ""racism and hate speech.""  We begrudgingly complied but all sent very polite and in-depth messages to Proboards explaining how nothing in the documentary was ""hateful or racist,"" and were received with similar silence. It is clear that the Jew shills have had enough and they're in over-drive trying to shut down the true IFERS flat Earth renaissance, while simultaneously setting up all of their controlled opposition fake flat Earthers to infiltrate, co-opt, and assimilate the FE movement like the Borg.  Contrary to their mantra however, resistence is NOT futile, and their desperate, under-handed attempts to stop the flat Earth truth from surfacing will all fail. Several months ago their fake flat Earther agents Paul Cheeft and PolarizationNationMedia both attempted to have my YouTube channel shut down, by issuing two fraudulent copyright strikes against me, both of which I managed to overturn by filing legal counter-claims against them.  Around that time Facebook also decided to jump on the ""Eric Dubay censorship bandwagon"" by deleting my account, all my pages, and giving my Atlantean Conspiracy group directly over to a team of fake FE shills who still administrate it to this day filling the group with nothing but death threats to me, pictures of Masonic goats, and ridiculous belittling memes.  After re-registering for new accounts and accumulating my friends lists again, Facebook has now deleted two more profiles, and I am currently on my fourth! where he ex-post-facto declares himself President of IFERS and bought 50 other flat Earth domain names which ""he and his team"" are busy making lousy websites for, none of which have seen any censorship.  Even though I have provably been researching and spreading flat Earth truth since 2009, Paul has repeatedly lied claiming to be the ""Morpheus to my Neo"" and to have awoken me to flat Earth in 2014.  He admits himself to having only become a flat Earther in 2013, but has the gall to continue claiming he ""taught me everything"" several years after I had already been publicly posting articles about As I have declared many times before, I will never cease writing and speaking the truth regardless of threats or how many times/ways I am censored.  They say those who are directly over the target receive the most flak.  No other flat Earther has received nearly the level of hatred, threats and censorship that I have.  None of the dozens of shill forums started by Acenci, Paul Bales, PlaneTruth and others have been deleted or censored whatsoever. When the enemy wins a battle or gains ground, we must simply regain the ground lost and continue fighting.  So the real IFERS will now continue at"

53,200 Proofs Earth is Not a Spinning Ball,"This 35 page ebook full of photographs and diagrams is the perfect tool to help spark conversation and awaken your friends and family to the mother of all conspiracies.  Please make copies, print, distribute, re-upload and do everything you can to get this most important information out to the masses! 1)  The horizon always appears perfectly flat 360 degrees around the observer regardless of altitude.  All amateur balloon, rocket, plane and drone footage show a completely flat horizon over 20+ miles high.  Only NASA and other government “space agencies” show curvature in their fake CGI photos/videos. 2)  The horizon always rises to the eye level of the observer as altitude is gained, so you never have to look down to see it.  If Earth were in fact a globe, no matter how large, as you ascended the horizon would stay fixed and the observer / camera would have to tilt looking down further and further to see it. 3)  The natural physics of water is to find and maintain its level.  If Earth were a giant sphere tilted, wobbling and hurdling through infinite space then truly flat, consistently level surfaces would not exist here. But since Earth is in fact an extended flat plane, this fundamental physical property of fluids finding and remaining level is consistent with experience and common sense. 4)  Rivers run down to sea-level finding the easiest course, North, South, East, West and all other intermediary directions over the Earth at the same time.  If Earth were truly a spinning ball then many of these rivers would be impossibly flowing uphill, for example the Mississippi in its 3000 miles would have to ascend 11 miles before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. 5)  One portion of the Nile River flows for a thousand miles with a fall of only one foot.  Parts of the West African Congo, according to the supposed inclination and movement of the ball-Earth, would be sometimes running uphill and sometimes down.  This would also be the case for the Parana, Paraguay and other long rivers. 6)  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference as NASA and modern astronomy claim, spherical trigonometry dictates the surface of all standing water must curve downward an easily measurable 8 inches per mile multiplied by the square of the distance.  This means along a 6 mile channel of standing water, the Earth would dip 6 feet on either end from the central peak.  Every time such experiments have been conducted, however, standing water has proven to be perfectly level. 7)  Surveyors, engineers and architects are never required to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their projects.  Canals, railways, bridges and tunnels for example are always cut and laid horizontally, often over hundreds of miles without any allowance for curvature. 8)  The Suez Canal connecting the Mediterranean with the Red Sea is 100 miles long without any locks making the water an uninterrupted continuation of the two seas.  When constructed, the Earth’s supposed curvature was not taken into account, it was dug along a horizontal datum line 26 feet below sea-level, passing through several lakes from one sea to the other, with the datum line and water’s surface running perfectly parallel over the 100 miles. 9)  Engineer, W. Winckler was published in the Earth Review regarding the Earth’s supposed curvature, stating, “As an engineer of many years standing, I saw that this absurd allowance is only permitted in school books.  No engineer would dream of allowing anything of the kind.  I have projected many miles of railways and many more of canals and the allowance has not even been thought of, much less allowed for.  This allowance for curvature means this - that it is 8” for the first mile of a canal, and increasing at the ratio by the square of the distance in miles; thus a small navigable canal for boats, say 30 miles long, will have, by the above rule an allowance for curvature of 600 feet.  Think of that and then please credit engineers as not being quite such fools.  Nothing of the sort is allowed.  We no more think of allowing 600 feet for a line of 30 miles of railway or canal, than of wasting our time trying to square the circle” 10)  The London and Northwestern Railway forms a straight line 180 miles long between London and Liverpool.  The railroad’s highest point, midway at Birmingham station, is only 240 feet above sea-level.  If the world were actually a globe, however, curving 8 inches per mile squared, the 180 mile stretch of rail would form an arc with the center point at Birmingham raising over a mile, a full 5,400 feet above London and Liverpool. 11)  A surveyor and engineer of thirty years published in the Birmingham Weekly Mercury stated, “I am thoroughly acquainted with the theory and practice of civil engineering.  However bigoted some of our professors may be in the theory of surveying according to the prescribed rules, yet it is well known amongst us that such theoretical measurements are INCAPABLE OF ANY PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATION.  All our locomotives are designed to run on what may be regarded as TRUE LEVELS or FLATS.  There are, of course, partial inclines or gradients here and there, but they are always accurately defined and must be carefully traversed.  But anything approaching to eight inches in the mile, increasing as the square of the distance, COULD NOT BE WORKED BY ANY ENGINE THAT WAS EVER YET CONSTRUCTED.  Taking one station with another all over England and Scotland, it may be stated that all the platforms are ON THE SAME RELATIVE LEVEL.  The distance between Eastern and Western coasts of England may be set down as 300 miles.  If the prescribed curvature was indeed as represented, the central stations at Rugby or Warwick ought to be close upon three miles higher than a chord drawn from the two extremities.  If such was the case there is not a driver or stoker within the Kingdom that would be found to take charge of the train.  We can only laugh at those of your readers who seriously give us credit for such venturesome exploits, as running trains round spherical curves.  Horizontal curves on levels are dangerous enough, vertical curves would be a thousand times worse, and with our rolling stock constructed as at present physically impossible.” 12)  The Manchester Ship Canal Company published in the Earth Review stated, “It is customary in Railway and Canal constructions for all levels to be referred to a datum which is nominally horizontal and is so shown on all sections.  It is not the practice in laying out Public Works to make allowances for the curvature of the earth 13)  In a 19th century French experiment by M. M. Biot and Arago a powerful lamp with good reflectors was placed on the summit of Desierto las Palmas in Spain and able to be seen all the way from Camprey on the Island of Iviza.  Since the elevation of the two points were identical and the distance between covered nearly 100 miles, if Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, the light should have been more than 6600 feet, a mile and a quarter, below the line of sight! 14)  The Lieutenant-Colonel Portlock experiment used oxy-hydrogen Drummond’s lights and heliostats to reflect the sun’s rays across stations set up across 108 miles of St. George’s Channel.  If the Earth were actually a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Portlock’s light should have remained hidden under a mile and a half of curvature. 15)  If the Earth were truly a sphere 25,000 miles in circumference, airplane pilots would have to constantly correct their altitudes downwards so as to not fly straight off into “outer space;” a pilot wishing to simply maintain their altitude at a typical cruising speed of 500 mph, would have to constantly dip their nose downwards and descend 2,777 feet (over half a mile) every minute!  Otherwise, without compensation, in one hour’s time the pilot would find themselves 31.5 miles higher than expected. 16)  The experiment known as “Airy’s Failure” proved that the stars move relative to a stationary Earth and not the other way around.  By first filling a telescope with water to slow down the speed of light inside, then calculating the tilt necessary to get the starlight directly down the tube, Airy failed to prove the heliocentric theory since the starlight was already coming in the correct angle with no change necessary, and instead proved the geocentric model correct. 17)  “Olber’s Paradox” states that if there were billions of stars which are suns the night sky would be filled completely with light.  As Edgar Allen Poe said, “Were the succession of stars endless, then the background of the sky would present us a uniform luminosity, since there could exist absolutely no point, in all that background, at which would not exist a star.”  In fact Olber’s “Paradox” is no more a paradox than George Airy’s experiment was a “failure.”  Both are actually excellent refutations of the heliocentric spinning ball model. 18)  The Michelson-Morley and Sagnac experiments attempted to measure the change in speed of light due to Earth’s assumed motion through space.  After measuring in every possible different direction in various locations they failed to detect any significant change whatsoever, again proving the stationary geocentric model. 19)  Tycho Brahe famously argued against the heliocentric theory in his time, positing that if the Earth revolved around the Sun, the change in relative position of the stars after 6 months orbital motion could not fail to be seen.  He argued that the stars should seem to separate as we approach and come together as we recede.  In actual fact, however, after 190,000,000 miles of supposed orbit around the Sun, not a single inch of parallax can be detected in the stars, proving we have not moved at all. 20)  If Earth were truly constantly spinning Eastwards at over 1000mph, vertically-fired cannonballs and other projectiles should fall significantly due west.  In actual fact, however, whenever this has been tested, vertically-fired cannonballs shoot upwards an average of 14 seconds ascending, 14 seconds descending, and fall back to the ground no more than 2 feet away from the cannon, often directly back into the muzzle. 21)  If the Earth were truly constantly spinning Eastwards at over 1000mph, helicopters and hot-air balloons should be able to simply hover over the surface of the Earth and wait for their destinations to come to them! 22)  If Earth were truly constantly spinning Eastwards at over 1000mph, during the Red Bull stratosphere dive, Felix Baumgartner, spending 3 hours ascending over New Mexico, should have landed 2500 miles West into the Pacific Ocean but instead landed a few dozen miles East of the take-off point. 23)  Ball-believers often claim “gravity” magically and inexplicably drags the entire lower-atmosphere of the Earth in perfect synchronization up to some undetermined height where this progressively faster spinning atmosphere gives way to the non-spinning, non-gravitized, non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space.  Such non-sensical theories are debunked, however, by rain, fireworks, birds, bugs, clouds, smoke, planes and projectiles all of which would behave very differently if both the ball-Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards at 1000mph. 24)  If Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning eastwards over 1000mph then North/South facing cannons should establish a control while East-firing cannonballs should fall significantly farther than all others while West-firing cannonballs should fall significantly closer.  In actual fact, however, regardless of which direction cannons are fired, the distance covered is always the same. 25)  If Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning eastwards over 1000mph, then the average commercial airliner traveling 500mph should never be able to reach its Eastward destinations before they come speeding up from behind!  Likewise Westward destinations should be arrived at thrice the speed, but this is not the case. 26)  Quoting “Heaven and Earth” by Gabrielle Henriet, “If flying had been invented at the time of Copernicus, there is no doubt that he would have soon realized that his contention regarding the rotation of the earth was wrong, on account of the relation existing between the speed of an aircraft and that of the earth’s rotation. If the earth rotates, as it is said, at 1,000 miles an hour, and a plane flies in the same direction at only 500 miles, it is obvious that its place of destination will be farther removed every minute. On the other hand, if flying took place in the direction opposite to that of the rotation, a distance of 1,500 miles would be covered in one hour, instead of 500, since the speed of the rotation is to be added to that of the plane. It could also be pointed out that such a flying speed of 1,000 miles an hour, which is supposed to be that of the earth’s rotation, has recently been achieved, so that an aircraft flying at this rate in the same direction as that of the rotation could not cover any ground at all. It would remain suspended in mid-air over the spot from which it took off, since both speeds are equal.” 27)  If Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards over 1000mph, landing airplanes on such fast-moving runways which face all manner of directions North, South, East, West and otherwise would be practically impossible, yet in reality such fictional concerns are completely negligible. 28)  If the Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards over 1000mph, then clouds, wind and weather patterns could not casually and unpredictably go every which way, with clouds often travelling in opposing directions at varying altitudes simultaneously. 29)  If the Earth and its atmosphere were constantly spinning Eastwards over 1000mph, this should somewhere somehow be seen, heard, felt or measured by someone, yet no one in history has ever experienced this alleged Eastward motion; meanwhile, however, we can hear, feel and experimentally measure even the slightest Westward breeze. 30)  In his book “South Sea Voyages,” Arctic and Antarctic explorer Sir James Clarke Ross, described his experience on the night of November 27th, 1839 and his conclusion that the Earth must be motionless: “The sky being very clear … it enabled us to observe the higher stratum of clouds to be moving in an exactly opposite direction to that of the wind--a circumstance which is frequently recorded in our meteorological journal both in the north-east and south-east trades, and has also often been observed by former voyagers. Captain Basil Hall witnessed it from the summit of the Peak of Teneriffe; and Count Strzelechi, on ascending the volcanic mountain of Kiranea, in Owhyhee, reached at 4000 feet an elevation above that of the trade wind, and experienced the influence of an opposite current of air of a different hygrometric and thermometric condition … Count Strzelechi further informed me of the following seemingly anomalous circumstance--that at the height of 6000 feet he found the current of air blowing at right angles to both the lower strata, also of a different hygrometric and thermometric condition, but warmer than the inter-stratum. Such a state of the atmosphere is compatible only with the fact which other evidence has demonstrated, that the earth is at rest."" 31)  Quoting “Zetetic Cosmogeny” Thomas Winships states: “Let ‘imagination’ picture to the mind what force air would have which was set in motion by a spherical body of 8,000 miles in diameter, which in one hour was spinning round 1,000 mph, rushing through space at 65,000 mph and gyrating across the heavens?  Then let ‘conjecture’ endeavor to discover whether the inhabitants on such a globe could keep their hair on?  If the earth-globe rotates on its axis at the terrific rate of 1,000 miles an hour, such an immense mass would of necessity cause a tremendous rush of wind in the space it occupied.  The wind would go all one way, and anything like clouds which got ‘within the sphere of influence’ of the rotating sphere, would have to go the same way.  The fact that the earth is at rest is proved by kite flying.” 32)  If “gravity” is credited with being a force strong enough to hold the world’s oceans, buildings, people and atmosphere stuck to the surface of a rapidly spinning ball, then it is impossible for “gravity” to also simultaneously be weak enough to allow little birds, bugs, and planes to take-off and travel freely unabated in any direction. 33)  If “gravity” is credited with being a force strong enough to curve the massive expanse of oceans around a globular Earth, it would be impossible for fish and other creatures to swim through such forcefully held water. 34)  Ship captains in navigating great distances at sea never need to factor the supposed curvature of the Earth into their calculations.  Both Plane Sailing and Great Circle Sailing, the most popular navigation methods, use plane, not spherical trigonometry, making all mathematical calculations on the assumption that the Earth is perfectly flat.  If the Earth were in fact a sphere, such an errant assumption would lead to constant glaring inaccuracies.  Plane Sailing has worked perfectly fine in both theory and practice for thousands of years, however, and plane trigonometry has time and again proven more accurate than spherical trigonometry in determining distances across the oceans. 35)  If the Earth were truly a globe, then every line of latitude south of the equator would have to measure a gradually smaller and smaller circumference the farther South travelled.  If, however, the Earth is an extended plane, then every line of latitude south of the equator should measure a gradually larger and larger circumference the farther South travelled.  The fact that many captains navigating south of the equator assuming the globular theory have found themselves drastically out of reckoning, moreso the farther South travelled, testifies to the fact that the Earth is not a ball. 36)  During Captain James Clark Ross’s voyages around the Antarctic circumference, he often wrote in his journal perplexed at how they routinely found themselves out of accordance with their charts, stating that they found themselves an average of 12-16 miles outside their reckoning every day, later on further south as much as 29 miles. 37)  Lieutenant Charles Wilkes commanded a United States Navy exploration expedition to the Antarctic from 1838 to 1842, and in his journals also mentioned being consistently east of his reckoning, sometimes over 20 miles in less than 18 hours. 38)  To quote Reverend Thomas Milner, “In the southern hemisphere, navigators to India have often fancied themselves east of the Cape when still west, and have been driven ashore on the African coast, which, according to their reckoning, lay behind them.  This misfortune happened to a fine frigate, the Challenger, in 1845.  How came Her Majesty’s Ship ‘Conqueror,’ to be lost?  How have so many other noble vessels, perfectly sound, perfectly manned, perfectly navigated, been wrecked in calm weather, not only in dark night, or in a fog, but in broad daylight and sunshine - in the former case upon the coasts, in the latter, upon sunken rocks - from being ‘out of reckoning?’” The simple answer is that Earth is not a ball. 39)  Practical distance measurements taken from “The Australian Handbook, Almanack, Shippers’ and Importers’ Directory” state that the straight line distance between Sydney and Nelson is 1550 statute miles.  Their given difference in longitude is 22 degrees 2’14”.  Therefore if 22 degrees 2’14” out of 360 is 1550 miles, the entirety would measure 25,182 miles.  This is not only larger than the ball-Earth is said to be at the equator, but a whole 4262 miles greater than it would be at Sydney’s southern latitude on a globe of said proportions. 40)  From near Cape Horn, Chile to Port Philip in Melbourne, Australia the distance is 10,500 miles, or 143 degrees of longitude away.   Factoring in the remaining degrees to 360 makes for a total distance of 26,430 miles around this particular latitude, which is over 1500 miles wider than Earth is supposed to be at the equator, and many more thousands of miles wider than it is supposed to be at such Southern latitudes. 41)  Similar calculations made from the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa to Melbourne, Australia at an average latitude of 35.5 degrees South, have given an approximate figure of over 25,000 miles, which is again equal to or greater than the Earth’s supposed greatest circumference at the equator.  Calculations from Sydney, Australia to Wellington, New Zealand at an average of 37.5 degrees South have given an approximate circumference of 25,500 miles, greater still!  According to the ball-Earth theory, the circumference of the Earth at 37.5 degrees Southern latitude should be only 19,757 statute miles, almost six thousand miles less than such practical measurements. 42)  In the ball-Earth model Antarctica is an ice continent which covers the bottom of the ball from 78 degrees South latitude to 90 and is therefore not more than 12,000 miles in circumference.  Many early explorers including Captian Cook and James Clark Ross, however, in attempting Antarctic circumnavigation took 3 to 4 years and clocked 50-60,000 miles around.  The British ship Challenger also made an indirect but complete circumnavigation of Antarctica traversing 69,000 miles.  This is entirely inconsistent with the ball model. 43)  If Earth was a ball there are several flights in the Southern hemisphere which would have their quickest, straightest path over the Antarctic continent such as Santiago, Chile to Sydney, Australia.  Instead of taking the shortest, quickest route in a straight line over Antarctica, all such flights detour all manner of directions away from Antarctica instead claiming the temperatures too cold for airplane travel!  Considering the fact that there are plenty of flights to/from/over Antarctica, and NASA claims to have technology keeping them in conditions far colder (and far hotter) than any experienced on Earth, such an excuse is clearly just an excuse, and these flights aren’t made because they are impossible. 44)  If Earth was a ball, and Antarctica was too cold to fly over, the only logical way to fly from Sydney to Santiago would be a straight shot over the Pacific staying in the Southern hemisphere the entire way.  Re-fueling could be done in New Zealand or other Southern hemisphere destinations along the way if absolutely necessary.  In actual fact, however, Santiago-Sydney flights go into the Northern hemisphere making stop-overs at LAX and other North American airports before continuing back down to the Southern hemisphere.  Such ridiculously wayward detours make no sense on the globe but make perfect sense and form nearly straight lines when shown on a flat Earth map. 45)  On a ball-Earth, Johannesburg, South Africa to Perth, Australia should be a straight shot over the Indian Ocean with convenient re-fueling possibilities on Mauritus or Madagascar.  In actual practice, however, most Johannesburg to Perth flights curiously stop over either in Dubai, Hong Kong or Malaysia all of which make no sense on the ball, but are completely understandable when mapped on a flat Earth. 46)  On a ball-Earth Cape Town, South Africa to Buenos Aries, Argentina should be a straight shot over the Atlantic following the same line of latitude across, but instead every flight goes to connecting locations in the Northern hemisphere first, stopping over anywhere from London to Turkey to Dubai.  Once again these make absolutely no sense on the globe but are completely understandable options when mapped on a flat Earth. 47)  On a ball-Earth Johannesburg, South Africa to Sao Paolo, Brazil should be a quick straight shot along the 25th Southern latitude, but instead nearly every flight makes a re-fueling stop at the 50th degree North latitude in London first!  The only reason such a ridiculous stop-over works in reality is because the Earth is flat. 48)  On a ball-Earth Santiago, Chile to Johannesburg, South Africa should be an easy flight all taking place below the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern hemisphere, yet every listed flight makes a curious re-fueling stop in Senegal near the Tropic of Cancer in the North hemisphere first!  When mapped on a flat Earth the reason why is clear to see, however, Senegal is actually directly in a straight-line path half-way between the two. 49)  If Earth were a spinning ball heated by a Sun 93 million miles away, it would be impossible to have simultaneously sweltering summers in Africa while just a few thousand miles away bone-chilling frozen Arctic/Antarctic winters experiencing little to no heat from the Sun whatsoever.  If the heat from the Sun traveled 93,000,000 miles to the Sahara desert, it is absurd to assert that another 4,000 miles (0.00004%) further to Antarctica would completely negate such sweltering heat resulting in such drastic differences. 50)  If the Earth were truly a globe, the Arctic and Antarctic polar regions and areas of comparable latitude North and South of the equator should share similar conditions and characteristics such as comparable temperatures, seasonal changes, length of daylight, plant and animal life.  In reality, however, the Arctic/Antarctic regions and areas of comparable latitude North/South of the equator differ greatly in many ways entirely inconsistent with the ball model and entirely consistent with the flat model. 51)  Antarctica is by far the coldest place on Earth with an average annual temperature of approximately -57 degrees Fahrenheit, and a record low of -135.8!  The average annual temperature at the North Pole, however, is a comparatively warm 4 degrees.  Throughout the year, temperatures in the Antarctic vary less than half the amount at comparable Arctic latitudes.  The Northern Arctic region enjoys moderately warm summers and manageable winters, whereas the Southern Antarctic region never even warms enough to melt the perpetual snow and ice.  On a tilting, wobbling, ball-Earth spinning uniformly around the Sun, Arctic and Antarctic temperatures and seasons should not vary so greatly. 52)  Iceland at 65 degrees North latitude is home to 870 species of native plants and abundant various animal life.  Compare this with the Isle of Georgia at just 54 degrees South latitude where there are only 18 species of native plants and animal life is almost non-existent.  The same latitude as Canada or England in the North where dense forests of various tall trees abound, the infamous Captain Cook wrote of Georgia that he was unable to find a single shrub large enough to make a toothpick!  Cook wrote, “Not a tree was to be seen.  The lands which lie to the south are doomed by nature to perpetual frigidness - never to feel the warmth of the sun’s rays; whose horrible and savage aspect I have not words to describe.  Even marine life is sparse in certain tracts of vast extent, and the sea-bird is seldom observed flying over such lonely wastes.  The contrasts between the limits of organic life in Arctic and Antarctic zones is very remarkable and significant.” 53)  At places of comparable latitude North and South, the Sun behaves very differently than it would on a spinning ball Earth but precisely how it should on a flat Earth.  For example, the longest summer days North of the equator are much longer than those South of the equator, and the shortest winter days North of the equator are much shorter than the shortest South of the equator.  This is inexplicable on a uniformly spinning, wobbling ball Earth but fits exactly on the flat model with the Sun traveling circles over and around the Earth from Tropic to Tropic. 54)  At places of comparable latitude North and South, dawn and dusk happen very differently than they would on a spinning ball, but precisely how they should on a flat Earth.  In the North dawn and dusk come slowly and last far longer than in the South where they come and go very quickly.  Certain places in the North twilight can last for over an hour while at comparable Southern latitudes within a few minutes the sunlight completely disappears.  This is inexplicable on a uniformly spinning, wobbling ball Earth but is exactly what is expected on a flat Earth with the Sun traveling faster, wider circles over the South and slower, narrower circles over the North. 55)  If the Sun circles over and around the Earth every 24 hours, steadily travelling from Tropic to Tropic every 6 months, it follows that the Northern, central region would annually receive far more heat and sunlight than the Southern circumferential region.  Since the Sun must sweep over the larger Southern region in the same 24 hours it has to pass over the smaller Northern region, its passage must necessarily be proportionally faster as well.  This perfectly explains the differences in Arctic/Antarctic temperatures, seasons, length of daylight, plant and animal life; this is why the Antarctic morning dawn and evening twilight are very abrupt compared with the North; and this explains why many midsummer Arctic nights the Sun does not set at all! 56)  The “Midnight Sun” is an Arctic phenomenon occurring annually during the summer solstice where for several days straight an observer significantly far enough north can watch the Sun traveling circles over-head, rising and falling in the sky throughout the day, but never fully setting for upwards of 72+ hours!  If the Earth were actually a spinning globe revolving around the Sun, the only place such a phenomenon as the Midnight Sun could be observed would be at the poles.  Any other vantage point from 89 degrees latitude downwards could never, regardless of any tilt or inclination, see the Sun for 24 hours straight.  To see the Sun for an entire revolution on a spinning globe at a point other than the poles, you would have to be looking through miles and miles of land and sea for part of the revolution! 57)  The establishment claims the Midnight Sun IS experienced in Antarctica but they conveniently do not have any uncut videos showing this, nor do they allow independent explorers to travel to Antarctica during the winter solstice to verify or refute these claims.  Conversely, there are dozens of uncut videos publicly available showing the Arctic Midnight Sun and it has been verified beyond any shadow of a doubt. 58)  The Royal Belgian Geographical Society in their “Expedition Antarctique Belge,” recorded that during the most severe part of the Antarctic winter, from 71 degrees South latitude onwards, the sun sets on May 17th and is not seen above the horizon again until July 21st!  This is completely at odds with the ball-Earth theory, but easily explained by the flat-Earth model.  The Midnight Sun is seen from high altitudes in extreme Northern latitudes during Arctic summer because the Sun, at its inner-most cycle, is circling tightly enough around the polar center that it remains visible above the horizon for someone at such a vantage point.  Likewise, in extreme Southern latitudes during Arctic summer, the Sun completely disappears from view for over 2 months because there at the Northern Tropic, at the inner-most arc of its boomerang journey, the Sun is circling the Northern center too tightly to be seen from the Southern circumference. 59)  Quoting Gabrielle Henriet, “The theory of the rotation of the earth may once and for all be definitely disposed of as impracticable by pointing out the following inadvertence. It is said that the rotation takes twenty-four hours and that its speed is uniform, in which case, necessarily, days and nights should have an identical duration of twelve hours each all the year round. The sun should invariably rise in the morning and set in the evening at the same hours, with the result that it would be the equinox every day from the 1st of January to the 31st of December. One should stop and reflect on this before saying that the earth has a movement of rotation. How does the system of gravitation account for the seasonal variations in the lengths of days and nights if the earth rotates at a uniform speed in twenty-four hours!?” 60)  Anyone can prove the sea-horizon perfectly straight and the entire Earth perfectly flat using nothing more than a level, tripods and a wooden plank.  At any altitude above sea-level, simply fix a 6-12 foot long, smooth, leveled board edgewise upon tripods and observe the skyline from eye-level behind it.   The distant horizon will always align perfectly parallel with the upper edge of the board.  Furthermore, if you move in a half-circle from one end of the board to the other whilst observing the skyline over the upper edge, you will be able to trace a clear, flat 10-20 miles depending on your altitude.  This would be impossible if the Earth were a globe 25,000 miles in circumference; the horizon would align over the center of the board but then gradually, noticeably decline towards the extremities.  Just ten miles on each side would necessitate an easily visible curvature of 66.6 feet from each end to the center. 61)  If the Earth were actually a big ball 25,000 miles in circumference, the horizon would be noticeably curved even at sea-level, and everything on or approaching the horizon would appear to tilt backwards slightly from your perspective.  Distant buildings along the horizon would all look like leaning towers of Piza falling away from the observer.  A  hot-air balloon taking off then drifting steadily away from you, on a ball-Earth would slowly and constantly appear to lean back more and more the farther away it flew, the bottom of the basket coming gradually into view as the top of the balloon disappears from sight.  In reality, however, buildings, balloons, trees, people, anything and everything at right angles to the ground/horizon remains so regardless the distance or height of the observer. 62)  Samuel Rowbotham’s experiments at the Old Bedford Level proved conclusively the canal’s water to be completely flat over a 6 mile stretch.  First he stood in the canal with his telescope held 8 inches above the surface of the water, then his friend in a boat with a 5 foot tall flag sailed the 6 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference the 6 mile stretch of water should have comprised an arc exactly 6 feet high in the middle, so the entire boat and flag should have ultimately disappeared, when in fact the entire boat and flag remained visible at the same height for the entire journey. 63)  In a second experiment Dr. Rowbotham affixed flags 5 feet high along the shoreline, one at every mile marker.  Then using his telescope mounted at 5 feet just behind the first flag looked over the tops of all 6 flags which lined up in a perfectly straight line.  If the Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference the flags should have progressively dipped down after the first establishing line of sight, the second would have descended 8 inches, 32 inches for the third, 6 feet for the fourth, 10 feet 8 inches for the fifth, and 16 feet 8 inches for the sixth. 64)  Quoting “Earth Not a Globe!” by Samuel Rowbotham, “It is known that the horizon at sea, whatever distance it may extend to the right and left of the observer on land, always appears as a straight line.  The following experiment has been tried in various parts of the country.  At Brighton, on a rising ground near the race course, two poles were fixed in the earth six yards apart, and directly opposite the sea.  Between these poles a line was tightly stretched parallel to the horizon.  From the center of the line the view embraced not less than 20 miles on each side making a distance of 40 miles.  A vessel was observed sailing directly westwards; the line cut the rigging a little above the bulwarks, which it did for several hours or until the vessel had sailed the whole distance of 40 miles.  The ship coming into view from the east would have to ascend an inclined plane for 20 miles until it arrived at the center of the arc, whence it would have to descend for the same distance.  The square of 20 miles multiplied by 8 inches gives 266 feet as the amount the vessel would be below the line at the beginning and at the end of the 40 miles.” 65)  Also Quoting Dr. Rowbotham, “On the shore near Waterloo, a few miles to the north of Liverpool, a good telescope was fixed, at an elevation of 6 feet above the water. It was directed to a large steamer, just leaving the River Mersey, and sailing out to Dublin. Gradually the mast-head of the receding vessel came nearer to the horizon, until, at length, after more than four hours had elapsed, it disappeared. The ordinary rate of sailing of the Dublin steamers was fully eight miles an hour; so that the vessel would be, at least, thirty-two miles distant when the mast-head came to the horizon. The 6 feet of elevation of the telescope would require three miles to be deducted for convexity, which would leave twenty-nine miles, the square of which, multiplied by 8 inches, gives 560 feet; deducting 80 feet for the height of the main-mast, and we find that, according to the doctrine of rotundity, the mast-head of the outward bound steamer should have been 480 feet below the horizon. Many other experiments of this kind have been made upon sea-going steamers, and always with results entirely incompatible with the theory that the earth is a globe.” 66)  Dr. Rowbotham conducted several other experiments using telescopes, spirit levels, sextants and “theodolites,” special precision instruments used for measuring angles in horizontal or vertical planes.  By positioning them at equal heights aimed at each other successively he proved over and over the Earth to be perfectly flat for miles without a single inch of curvature.  His findings caused quite a stir in the scientific community and thanks to 30 years of his efforts, the shape of the Earth became a hot topic of debate around the turn of the nineteenth century. 67)  The distance across the Irish Sea from the Isle of Man’s Douglas Harbor to Great Orm’s Head in North Wales is 60 miles.  If the Earth was a globe then the surface of the water between them would form a 60 mile arc, the center towering 1944 feet higher than the coastlines at either end.  It is well-known and easily verifiable, however, that on a clear day, from a modest altitude of 100 feet, the Great Orm’s Head is visible from Douglas Harbor.  This would be completely impossible on a globe of 25,000 miles.  Assuming the 100 foot altitude causes the horizon to appear approximately 13 miles off, the 47 miles remaining means the Welsh coastline should still fall an impossible 1472 feet below the line of sight! 68)  The Philadelphia skyline is clearly visible from Apple Pie Hill in the New Jersey Pine Barrens 40 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, factoring in the 205 foot elevation of Apple Pie Hill, the Philly skyline should remain well-hidden beyond 335 feet of curvature. 69)  The New York City skyline is clearly visible from Harriman State Park’s Bear Mountain 60 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, viewing from Bear Mountain’s 1,283 foot summit, the Pythagorean Theorem determining distance to the horizon being 1.23 times the square root of the height in feet, the NYC skyline should be invisible behind 170 feet of curved Earth. 70)  From Washington’s Rock in New Jersey, at just a 400 foot elevation, it is possible on a clear day to see the skylines of both New York and Philadelphia in opposite directions at the same time covering a total distance of 120 miles!  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, both of these skylines should be hidden behind over 800 feet of Earth’s curvature. 71)  It is often possible to see the Chicago skyline from sea-level 60 miles away across Lake Michigan.  In 2015 after photographer Joshua Nowicki photographed this phenomenon several news channels quickly claimed his picture to be a “superior mirage,” an atmospheric anomaly caused by temperature inversion.  While these certainly do occur, the skyline in question was facing right-side up and clearly seen unlike a hazy illusory mirage, and on a ball-Earth 25,000 miles in circumference should be 2,400 feet below the horizon. 72)  October 16, 1854 the Times newspaper reported the Queen’s visit to Great Grimsby from Hull recording they were able to see the 300 foot tall dock tower from 70 miles away.  On a ball-Earth 25,000 miles in circumference, factoring their 10 foot elevation above the water and the tower’s 300 foot height, at 70 miles away the dock tower should have remained an entire 2,600 feet below the horizon. 73)  In 1872 Capt. Gibson and crewmates, sailing the ship “Thomas Wood” from China to London, reported seeing the entirety of St. Helena Island on a clear day from 75 miles away.  Factoring in their height during measurement on a ball-Earth 25,000 miles in circumference, it was found the island should have been 3,650 feet below their line of sight. 74)  From Genoa, Italy at a height of just 70 feet above sea-level, the island of Gorgona can often be seen 81 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Gorgona should be hidden beyond 3,332 feet of curvature. 75)  From Genoa, Italy at a height of just 70 feet above sea-level, the island of Corsica can often be seen 99 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Corsica should fall 5,245 feet, almost an entire mile below the horizon. 76)  From Genoa, Italy 70 feet above sea-level, the island of Capraia 102 miles away can often be seen as well.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Capraia should always remain hidden behind 5,605 feet, over a mile of supposed curvature. 77)  Also from Genoa, on bright clear days, the island of Elba can be seen an incredible 125 miles away!  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Elba should be forever invisible behind 8770 feet of curvature. 78)  From Anchorage, Alaska at an elevation of 102 feet, on clear days Mount Foraker can be seen with the naked eye 120 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Mount Foraker’s 17,400 summit should be leaning back away from the observer covered by 7,719 feet of curved Earth.  In reality, however, the entire mountain can be quite easily seen standing straight from base to summit. 79)  From Anchorage, Alaska at an elevation of 102 feet, on clear days Mount McKinley can be seen with the naked eye from 130 miles away.  If Earth were a ball 25,000 miles in circumference, Mount McKinley’s 20,320 foot summit should be leaning back away from the observer and almost half covered by 9,220 feet of curved Earth.  In reality, however, the entire mountain can be quite easily seen standing straight from base to summit. 80)  In Chambers’ Journal, February 1895, a sailor near Mauritius in the Indian Ocean reported having seen a vessel which turned out to be an incredible 200 miles away!  The incident caused much heated debate in nautical circles at the time, gaining further confirmation in Aden, Yemen where another witness reported seeing a missing Bombay steamer from 200 miles away.  He correctly stated the precise appearance, location and direction of the steamer all later corroborated and confirmed correct by those onboard.  Such sightings are absolutely inexplicable if the Earth were actually a ball 25,000 miles around, as ships 200 miles distant would have to fall approximately 5 miles below line of sight! 81)  The distance from which various lighthouse lights around the world are visible at sea far exceeds what could be found on a ball-Earth 25,000 miles in circumference.  For example, the Dunkerque Light in southern France at an altitude of 194 feet is visible from a boat (10 feet above sea-level) 28 miles away.  Spherical trigonometry dictates that if the Earth was a globe with the given curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, this light should be hidden 190 feet below the horizon. 82)  The Port Nicholson Light in New Zealand is 420 feet above sea-level and visible from 35 miles away where it should be 220 feet below the horizon. 83)  The Egerö Light in Norway is 154 feet above high-water and visible from 28 statute miles where it should be 230 feet below the horizon. 84)  The Light at Madras, on the Esplanade, is 132 feet high and visible from 28 miles away, where it should be 250 feet below the line of sight. 85)  The Cordonan Light on the west coast of France is 207 feet high and visible from 31 miles away, where it should be 280 feet below the line of sight. 86)  The light at Cape Bonavista, Newfoundland is 150 feet above sea-level and visible at 35 miles, where it should be 491 feet below the horizon. 87)  The lighthouse steeple of St. Botolph’s Parish Church in Boston is 290 feet tall and visible from over 40 miles away, where it should be hidden a full 800 feet below the horizon! 88)  The Isle of Wight lighthouse in England is 180 feet high and can be seen up to 42 miles away, a distance at which modern astronomers say the light should fall 996 feet below line of sight. 89)  The Cape L’Agulhas lighthouse in South Africa is 33 feet high, 238 feet above sea level, and can be seen for over 50 miles.  If the world were a globe, this light would fall 1,400 feet below an observer’s line of sight. 90)  The Statue of Liberty in New York stands 326 feet above sea level and on a clear day can be seen as far as 60 miles away.  If the Earth were a globe, that would put Lady Liberty at an impossible 2,074 feet below the horizon. 91)  The lighthouse at Port Said, Egypt, at an elevation of only 60 feet has been seen an astonishing 58 miles away, where, according to modern astronomy it should be 2,182 feet below the line of sight! 92)  The Notre Dame Antwerp spire stands 403 feet high from the foot of the tower with Strasburg measuring 468 feet above sea level.  With the aid of a telescope, ships can be distinguished on the horizon and captains declare they can see the cathedral spire from an amazing 150 miles away.  If the Earth were a globe, however, at that distance the spire should be an entire mile, 5,280 feet below the horizon! 93)  The St. George’s Channel between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbor near Dublin is 60 miles across.  When half-way across a ferry passenger will notice behind them the light on Holyhead pier as well as in front of them the Poolbeg light in Dublin Bay.  The Holyhead Pier light is 44 feet high, while the Poolbeg lighthouse 68 feet, therefore a vessel in the middle of the channel, 30 miles from either side standing on a deck 24 feet above the water, can clearly see both lights.  On a ball Earth 25,000 miles in circumference, however, both lights should be hidden well below both horizons by over 300 feet! 94)  From the highland near Portsmouth Harbor in Hampshire, England looking across Spithead to the Isle of Wight, the entire base of the island, where water and land come together composes a perfectly straight line 22 statute miles long.  According to the ball-Earth theory, the Isle of Wight should decline 80 feet from the center on each side to account for the necessary curvature.  The cross-hairs of a good theodolite directed there, however, have repeatedly shown the land and water line to be perfectly level. 95)  On a clear day from the highland near Douglas Harbor on the Isle of Man, the whole length of the coast of North Wales is often plainly visible to the naked eye.  From the Point of Ayr at the mouth of the River Dee to Holyhead comprises a 50 mile stretch which has also been repeatedly found to be perfectly horizontal.  If the Earth actually had curvature of 8 inches per mile squared, as NASA and modern astronomy claim, the 50 mile length of Welsh coast seen along the horizon in Liverpool Bay would have to decline from the center-point an easily detectable 416 feet on each side! 96)  From “100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe” by William Carpenter, “If we take a journey down the Chesapeake Bay, by night, we shall see the ‘light’ exhibited at Sharpe's Island for an hour before the steamer gets to it. We may take up a position on the deck so that the rail of the vessel's side will be in a line with the ‘light’ and in the line of sight; and we shall find that in the whole journey the light won't vary in the slightest degree in its apparent elevation. But, say that a distance of thirteen miles has been traversed, the astronomers' theory of ‘curvature’ demands a difference (one way or the other!) in the apparent elevation of the light, of 112 feet 8 inches! Since, however, there is not a difference of 100 hair's breadths, we have a plain proof that the water of the Chesapeake Bay is not curved, which is a proof that the Earth is not a globe.” 97)  NASA and modern astronomy say the Earth is a giant ball tilted back, wobbling and spinning 1,000 mph around its central axis, traveling 67,000 mph circles around the Sun, spiraling 500,000 mph around the Milky Way, while the entire galaxy rockets a ridiculous 670,000,000 mph through the Universe, with all of these motions originating from an alleged “Big Bang” cosmogenic explosion 14 billion years ago.  That’s a grand total of 670,568,000 mph in several different directions we’re all supposedly speeding along at simultaneously, yet no one has ever seen, felt, heard, measured or proven a single one of these motions to exist whatsoever. 98)  NASA and modern astronomy say Polaris, the North Pole star, is somewhere between 323-434 light years, or about 2 quadrillion miles, away from us!  Firstly, note that is between 1,938,000,000,000,000 - 2,604,000,000,000,000 miles making a difference of 666,000,000,000,000 (over six hundred trillion) miles!  If modern astronomy cannot even agree on the distance to stars within hundreds of trillions of miles, perhaps their “science” is flawed and their theory needs re-examining.  However, even granting them their obscurely distant stars, it is impossible for heliocentrists to explain how Polaris manages to always remain perfectly aligned straight above the North Pole throughout Earth’s various alleged tilting, wobbling, rotating and revolving motions. 99)  Viewed from a ball-Earth, Polaris, situated directly over the North Pole, should not be visible anywhere in the Southern hemisphere.  For Polaris to be seen from the Southern hemisphere of a globular Earth, the observer would have to be somehow looking “through the globe,” and miles of land and sea would have to be transparent.  Polaris can be seen, however, up to over 20 degrees South latitude. 100)  If Earth were a ball, the Southern Cross and other Southern constellations would all be visible at the same time from every longitude on the same latitude as is the case in the North with Polaris and its surrounding constellations.  Ursa Major/Minor and many others can be seen from every Northern meridian simultaneously whereas in the South, constellations like the Southern Cross cannot.  This proves the Southern hemisphere is not “turned under” as in the ball-Earth model, but simply stretching further outwards away from the Northern center-point as in the flat Earth model. 101)  Sigma Octantis is claimed to be a Southern central pole star similar to Polaris, around which the Southern hemisphere stars all rotate around the opposite direction.  Unlike Polaris, however, Sigma Octantis can NOT be seen simultaneously from every point along the same latitude, it is NOT central but allegedly 1 degree off-center, it is NOT motionless, and in fact cannot be seen at all using publicly available telescopes!  There is legitimate speculation regarding whether Sigma Octantis even exists.  Either way, the direction in which stars move overhead is based on perspective and the exact direction you’re facing, not which hemisphere you are in. 102)  Some heliocentrists have tried to suggest that the Pole Star’s gradual declination overhead as an observer travels southwards is proof of a globular Earth.  Far from it, the declination of the Pole Star or any other object is simply a result of the Law of Perspective on plane (flat) surfaces.  The Law of Perspective dictates that the angle and height at which an object is seen diminishes the farther one recedes from the object, until at a certain point the line of sight and the seemingly uprising surface of the Earth converges to a vanishing point (i.e. the horizon line) beyond which the object is invisible.  In the ball-Earth model the horizon is claimed to be the curvature of the Earth, whereas in reality, the horizon is known to be simply the vanishing line of perspective based on the strength of your eyes, instruments, weather and altitude. 103)  There are several constellations which can be seen from far greater distances over the face of the Earth than should be possible if the world were a rotating, revolving, wobbling ball.  For instance, Ursa Major, very close to Polaris, can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude (the North Pole) all the way down to 30 degrees South latitude.  For this to be possible on a ball-Earth the Southern observers would have to be seeing through hundreds or thousands of miles of bulging Earth to the Northern sky. 104)  The constellation Vulpecula can be seen from 90 degrees North latitude, all the way to 55 degrees South latitude.  Taurus, Pisces and Leo can be seen from 90 degrees North all the way to 65 degrees South.  An observer on a ball-Earth, regardless of any tilt or inclination, should not logically be able to see this far. 105)  Aquarius and Libra can be seen from 65 degrees North to 90 degrees South!  The constellation Virgo is visible from 80 degrees North down to 80 degrees South, and Orion can be seen from 85 degrees North all the way to 75 degrees South latitude!  These are all only possible because the “hemispheres” are not spheres at all but concentric circles of latitude extending outwards from the central North Pole with the stars rotating over and around. 106)  The so-called “South Pole” is simply an arbitrary point along the Antarctic ice marked with a red and white barbershop pole topped with a metal ball-Earth.  This ceremonial South Pole is admittedly and provably NOT the actual South Pole, however, because the actual South Pole could be demonstrably confirmed with the aid of a compass showing North to be 360 degrees around the observer.  Since this feat has never been achieved, the model remains pure theory, along with the establishment’s excuse that the geomagnetic poles supposedly constantly move around making verification of their claims impossible. 107)  Ring magnets of the kind found in loudspeakers have a central North pole with the opposite “South” pole actually being all points along the outer circumference.  This perfectly demonstrates the magnetism of our flat Earth, whereas the alleged source of magnetism in the ball-Earth model is emitted from a hypothetical molten magnetic core in the center of the ball which they claim conveniently causes both poles to constantly move thus evading independent verification at their two “ceremonial poles.”  In reality the deepest drilling operation in history, the Russian Kola Ultradeep, managed to get only 8 miles down, so the entire ball-Earth model taught in schools showing a crust, outer-mantle, inner-mantle, outer-core and inner-core layers are all purely speculation as we have never penetrated through beyond the crust. 108)  The mariner’s compass is an impossible and non-sensical instrument for use on a ball-Earth.  It simultaneously points North and South over a flat surface, yet claims to be pin-pointing two constantly moving geomagnetic poles at opposite ends of a spinning sphere originating from a hypothetical molten metal core.  If compass needles were actually drawn to the North pole of a globe, the opposing “South” needle would actually be pointing up and off into outer-space. 109)  There are no fixed “East” or “West” points just as there is no fixed “South.”  The North central Pole is the only proven fixed point on our flat Earth, with South being all straight lines outwards from the pole, East and West being concentric circles at constant right angles 90 degrees from the pole.  A westerly circumnavigation of Earth is thus going around with Polaris continually on your right, while an easterly circumnavigation is going around with Polaris always at your left. 110)  Magellan and others’ East/West circumnavigations of Earth are often quoted as proof of the ball model.  In actual fact, however, sailing or flying at rights angles to the North pole and eventually returning to one’s original location is no more difficult or mysterious than doing so on a globe.  Just as an architect’s compass can place its center-point on a flat piece of paper and trace a circle either way around the “pole,” so can a ship or plane circumnavigate a flat-Earth. 111)  Since the North Pole and Antarctica are covered in ice and guarded “no-fly” zones, no ships or planes have ever been known to circumnavigate the Earth in North/South directions.  The only kind of circumnavigation which could not happen on a flat-Earth is North/Southbound, which is likely the very reason for the heavily-enforced flight restrictions.  The fact that there has yet to be a single verified North/South circumnavigation of Earth serves as standing proof the world is not a ball. 112)  The Sun brings noon to every time-zone as it passes directly over-head every 15 degree demarcation point, 24 times per day in its circular path over and around the Earth.  If time-zones were instead caused by the uniform spinning of the ball-Earth around the Sun, every 6 months as Earth found itself on the opposite side of the Sun, clocks all over Earth would have to flip 12 hours, day would be night and night would be day. 113)  The idea that people are standing, ships are sailing and planes are flying upside down on certain parts of Earth while others tilted at 90 degrees and all other impossible angles is complete absurdity.  The idea that a man digging a hole straight down could eventually reach sky on the other side is ludicrous.  Common sense tells every free-thinking person correctly that there truly is an “up” and “down” in nature, unlike the “everything is relative” rhetoric of the Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm. 114)  Quoting, “On the False Wisdom of the Philosophers” by Lacantius, “A sphere where people on the other side live with their feet above their heads, where rain, snow and hail fall upwards, where trees and crops grow upside-down and the sky is lower than the ground?  The ancient wonder of the hanging gardens of Babylon dwindle into nothing in comparison to the fields, seas, towns and mountains that pagan philosophers believe to be hanging from the earth without support!” 115)  The existing laws of density and buoyancy perfectly explained the physics of falling objects long before knighted Freemason “Sir” Isaac Newton bestowed his theory of “gravity” upon the world.  It is a fact that objects placed in denser mediums rise up while objects placed in less dense mediums sink down.  To fit with the heliocentric model which has no up or down, Newton instead claimed objects are attracted to large masses and fall towards the center.  Not a single experiment in history, however, has shown an object massive enough to, by virtue of its mass alone, cause other smaller masses to be attracted to it as Newton claims “gravity” does with Earth, the Sun, Moon, Stars and Planets. 116)  There has also never been a single experiment in history showing an object massive enough to, by virtue of its mass alone, cause another smaller mass to orbit around it.  The magic theory of gravity allows for oceans, buildings and people to remain forever stuck to the underside of a spinning ball while simultaneously causing objects like the Moon and satellites to remain locked in perpetual circular orbits around the Earth.  If these were both true then people should be able to jump up and start orbiting circles around the Earth, or the Moon should have long ago been sucked into the Earth.  Neither of these theories have ever been experimentally verified and their alleged results are mutually exclusive. 117)  Newton also theorized and it is now commonly taught that the Earth’s ocean tides are caused by gravitational lunar attraction.  If the Moon is only 2,160 miles in diameter and the Earth 8,000 miles, however, using their own math and “law,” it follows that the Earth is 87 times more massive and therefore the larger object should attract the smaller to it, and not the other way around.  If the Earth’s greater gravity is what keeps the Moon in orbit, it is impossible for the Moon’s lesser gravity to supersede the Earth’s gravity, especially at Earth’s sea-level, where its gravitational attraction would even further out-trump the Moon’s.  And if the Moon’s gravity truly did supersede the Earth’s causing the tides to be drawn towards it, there should be nothing to stop them from continuing onwards and upwards towards their great attractor. 118)  Furthermore, the velocity and path of the Moon are uniform and should therefore exert a uniform influence on the Earth’s tides, when in actuality the Earth’s tides vary greatly and do not follow the Moon. Earth’s lakes, ponds, marshes and other inland bodies of water also inexplicably remain forever outside the Moon’s gravitational grasp!  If “gravity” was truly drawing Earth’s oceans up to it, all lakes, ponds and other bodies of standing water should certainly have tides as well. 119)  It is claimed that the other planets are spheres and so therefore Earth must also be a sphere.  Firstly, Earth is a “plane” not a “planet,” so the shape of these “planets” in the sky have no bearing on the shape of the Earth beneath our feet.  Secondly, these “planets” have been known for thousands of years around the world as the “wandering stars” since they differ from the other fixed stars in their relative motions only.  When looked at with an unprejudiced naked-eye or through a telescope, the fixed and wandering stars appear as luminous discs of light, NOT spherical terra firma.  The pictures and videos shown by NASA of spherical terra firma planets are all clearly fake computer-generated images, and NOT photographs. 120)  The etymology of the word “planet” actually comes from late Old English planete, from Old French planete (Modern French planète), from Latin planeta, from Greek planetes, from (asteres) planetai “wandering (stars),” from planasthai “to wander,” of unknown origin, possibly from PIE *pele “flat, to spread” or notion of “spread out.”  And Plane (n) “flat surface,” c. 1600, from Latin planum “flat surface, plane, level, plain,” planus “flat, level, even, plain, clear.”  They just added a “t” to our Earth plane and everyone bought it. 121)  When you observe the Sun and Moon you see two equally-sized equidistant circles tracing similar paths at similar speeds around a flat, stationary Earth.  The “experts” at NASA, however, claim your common sense every day experience is false on all counts!  To begin with, they say the Earth is not flat but a big ball; not stationary but spinning around 19 miles per second; they say the Sun does not revolve around the Earth as it appears, but Earth revolves around the Sun; the Moon, on the other hand, does revolve around the Earth, though not East to West as it appears, rather West to East; and the Sun is actually 400 times larger than the Moon and 400 times farther away!  You can clearly see they are the same size and distance, you can see the Earth is flat, you can feel the Earth is stationary, but according to the gospel of modern astronomy, you are wrong and a simpleton worthy of endless ridicule if you dare to trust your own eyes and experience. 122)  Quoting Allen Daves, “If the Government or NASA had said to you that the Earth is stationary, imagine that. And then imagine we are trying to convince people that 'no, no it's not stationary, it's moving forward at 32 times rifle bullet speed and spinning at 1,000 miles per hour.' We would be laughed at! We would have so many people telling us 'you are crazy, the Earth is not moving!' We would be ridiculed for having no scientific backing for this convoluted moving Earth theory. And not only that but then people would say, 'oh then how do you explain a fixed, calm atmosphere and the Sun's observable movement, how do you explain that?' Imagine saying to people, 'no, no, the atmosphere is moving also but is somehow magically velcroed to the moving-Earth. The reason is not simply because the Earth is stationary.' So what we are actually doing is what makes sense. We are saying that the moving-Earth theory is nonsense. The stationary-Earth theory makes sense and we are being ridiculed. You've got to picture it being the other way around to realize just how RIDICULOUS this situation is. This theory from the Government and NASA that the Earth is rotating and orbiting and leaning over and wobbling is absolute nonsense and yet people are clinging to it, tightly, like a teddy bear. They just can't bring themselves to face the possibility that the Earth is stationary though ALL the evidence shows it: we feel no movement, the atmosphere hasn't been blown away, we see the Sun move from East-to-West, everything can be explained by a motionless Earth without bringing in all these assumptions to cover up previous assumptions gone bad.” 123)  Heliocentrists’ astronomical figures always sound perfectly precise, but they have historically been notorious for regularly and drastically changing them to suit their various models.  For instance, in his time Copernicus calculated the Sun’s distance from Earth to be 3,391,200 miles.  The next century Johannes Kepler decided it was actually 12,376,800 miles away.  Issac Newton once said, “It matters not whether we reckon it 28 or 54 million miles distant for either would do just as well!”  How scientific!?  Benjamin Martin calculated between 81 and 82 million miles, Thomas Dilworth claimed 93,726,900 miles, John Hind stated positively 95,298,260 miles, Benjamin Gould said more than 96 million miles, and Christian Mayer thought it was more than 104 million!  Flat-Earthers throughout the ages, conversely, have used sextants and plane trigonometry to make such calculations and found the Sun and Moon both to be only about 32 miles in diameter and less than a few thousand miles from Earth. 124)  Amateur balloon footage taken above the clouds has provided stunning visual proof that the Sun cannot be millions of miles away.  In several shots you can see a clear hot-spot reflecting on the clouds directly below the Sun’s spotlight-like influence.  If the Sun were actually millions of miles away such a small, localized hot-spot could not occur. 125)  Another proof the Sun is not millions of miles away is found by tracing the angle of sun-rays back to their source above the clouds.  There are thousands of pictures showing how sunlight comes down through cloud-cover at a variance of converging angles.  The area of convergence is of course the Sun, and is clearly NOT millions of miles away, but rather relatively close to Earth just above the clouds. 126)  The Sun’s annual journey from tropic to tropic, solstice to solstice, is what determines the length and character of days, nights and seasons.  This is why equatorial regions experience almost year-round summer and heat while higher latitudes North and especially South experience more distinct seasons with harsh winters.  The heliocentric model claims seasons change based on the ball-Earth’s alleged “axial tilt” and “elliptical orbit” around the Sun, yet their flawed current model places us closest to the Sun (91,400,000 miles) in January when its actually winter, and farthest from the Sun (94,500,000 miles) in July when its actually summer throughout most of the Earth. 127)  The fact that the Sun and Moon’s reflections on water always form a straight line path from the horizon to the observer proves the Earth is not a ball.  If Earth’s surface was curved it would be impossible for the reflected light to curve over the ball from horizon to observer. 128)  There are huge centuries-old stone sundials and moondials all over the world which still tell the time now down to the minute as perfectly as the day they were made.  If the Earth, Sun and Moon were truly subject to the number of contradictory revolving, rotating, wobbling and spiraling motions claimed by modern astronomy, it would be impossible for these monuments to so accurately tell time without constant adjustment. 129)  To quote William Carpenter, “Why, in the name of common sense, should observers have to fix their telescopes on solid stone bases so that they should not move a hair's-breadth, - if the Earth on which they fix them moves at the rate of nineteen miles in a second? Indeed, to believe that ‘six thousand million million million tons’ is ‘rolling, surging, flying, darting on through space for ever’ with a velocity compared with which a shot from a cannon is a ‘very slow coach,’ with such unerring accuracy that a telescope fixed on granite pillars in an observatory will not enable a lynx-eyed astronomer to detect a variation in its onward motion of the thousandth part of a hair's-breadth is to conceive a miracle compared with which all the miracles on record put together would sink into utter insignificance.  Since we can, (in middle north latitudes), see the North Star, on looking out of a window that faces it - and out of the very same corner of the very same pane of glass in the very same window - all the year round, it is proof enough for any man in his senses that we have made no motion at all and that the Earth is not a globe.” 130)  From “Earth Not a Globe!” by Samuel Rowbotham, “Take two carefully-bored metallic tubes, not less than six feet in length, and place them one yard asunder, on the opposite sides of a wooden frame, or a solid block of wood or stone: so adjust them that their centres or axes of vision shall be perfectly parallel to each other. Now, direct them to the plane of some notable fixed star, a few seconds previous to its meridian time. Let an observer be stationed at each tube and the moment the star appears in the first tube let a loud knock or other signal be given, to be repeated by the observer at the second tube when he first sees the same star. A distinct period of time will elapse between the signals given. The signals will follow each other in very rapid succession, but still, the time between is sufficient to show that the same star is not visible at the same moment by two parallel lines of sight when only one yard asunder. A slight inclination of the second tube towards the first tube would be required for the star to be seen through both tubes at the same instant. Let the tubes remain in their position for six months; at the end of which time the same observation or experiment will produce the same results--the star will be visible at the same meridian time, without the slightest alteration being required in the direction of the tubes: from which it is concluded that if the earth had moved one single yard in an orbit through space, there would at least be observed the slight inclination of the tube which the difference in position of one yard had previously required. But as no such difference in the direction of the tube is required, the conclusion is unavoidable, that in six months a given meridian upon the earth's surface does not move a single yard, and therefore, that the earth has not the slightest degree of orbital motion."" 131)  NASA and modern astronomy maintain that the Moon is a solid, spherical, Earth-like habitation which man has actually flown to and set foot on.  They claim the Moon is a non-luminescent planetoid which receives and reflects all its light from the Sun.  The reality is, however, that the Moon is observably not a solid body, it is clearly circular, but not spherical, and not in any way an Earth-like planetoid which humans could set foot on.  In fact, the Moon has been proven largely transparent and completely self-luminescent, shining with its own unique light. 132)  The Sun’s light is golden, warm, drying, preservative and antiseptic, while the Moon’s light is silver, cool, damp, putrefying and septic.  The Sun’s rays decrease the combustion of a bonfire, while the Moon’s rays increase combustion.  Plant and animal substances exposed to sunlight quickly dry, shrink, coagulate, and lose the tendency to decompose and putrify; grapes and other fruits become solid, partially candied and preserved like raisins, dates, and prunes; animal flesh coagulates, loses its volatile gaseous constituents, becomes firm, dry, and slow to decay.  When exposed to moonlight, however, plant and animal substances tend to show symptoms of putrefaction and decay.  This proves that Sun and Moon light are different, unique, and opposites as they are in the geocentric flat model. 133)  In direct sunlight a thermometer will read higher than another thermometer placed in the shade, but in full, direct moonlight a thermometer will read lower than another placed in the shade.  If the Sun’s light is collected in a large lens and thrown to a focus point it can create significant heat, while the Moon’s light collected similarly creates no heat.  In the ""Lancet Medical Journal,” from March 14th, 1856, particulars are given of several experiments which proved the Moon's rays when concentrated can actually reduce the temperature upon a thermometer more than eight degrees.  So sunlight and moonlight clearly have altogether different properties. 134)  Furthermore the Moon itself cannot physically be both a spherical body and a reflector of the Sun’s light.  Reflectors must be flat or concave for light rays to have any angle of incidence; If a reflector’s surface is convex then every ray of light points in a direct line with the radius perpendicular to the surface resulting in no reflection. 135)  Not only is the Moon clearly self-luminescent, shining its own unique light, but it is also largely transparent. When the waxing or waning Moon is visible during the day it is possible to see the blue sky right through the Moon.  And on a clear night, during a waxing or waning cycle, it is even possible to occasionally see stars and “planets” directly through the surface of the Moon!  The Royal Astronomical Society has on record many such occurrences throughout history which all defy the heliocentric model. 136)  Many people think that modern astronomy’s ability to accurately predict lunar and solar eclipses is a result and proof positive of the heliocentric theory of the universe.  The fact of the matter however is that eclipses have been accurately predicted by cultures worldwide for thousands of years before the “heliocentric ball-Earth” was even a glimmer in Copernicus’ imagination.  Ptolemy in the 1st century A.D. accurately predicted eclipses for six hundred years on the basis of a flat, stationary Earth with equal precision as anyone living today.  All the way back in 600 B.C. Thales accurately predicted an eclipse which ended the war between the Medes and Lydians.  Eclipses happen regularly with precision in 18 year cycles, so regardless of geocentric or heliocentric, flat or globe Earth cosmologies, eclipses can be accurately calculated independent of such factors. 137)  Another assumption and supposed proof of Earth’s shape, heliocentrists claim that lunar eclipses are caused by the shadow of the ball-Earth occulting the Moon.  They claim the Sun, Earth, and Moon spheres perfectly align like three billiard balls in a row so that the Sun’s light casts the Earth’s shadow onto the Moon.  Unfortunately for heliocentrists, this explanation is rendered completely invalid due to the fact that lunar eclipses have happened and continue to happen regularly when both the Sun and Moon are still visible together above the horizon!  For the Sun’s light to be casting Earth’s shadow onto the Moon, the three bodies must be aligned in a straight 180 degree syzygy, but as early as the time of Pliny, there are records of lunar eclipses happening while both the Sun and Moon are visible in the sky.  Therefore the eclipsor of the Moon cannot be the Earth/Earth’s shadow and some other explanation must be sought. 138)  Another favorite “proof” of ball-Earthers is the appearance from an observer on shore of ships’ hulls being obfuscated by the water and disappearing from view when sailing away towards the horizon.  Their claim is that ships’ hulls disappear before their mast-heads because the ship is beginning its declination around the convex curvature of the ball-Earth.  Once again, however, their hasty conclusion is drawn from a faulty premise, namely that only on a ball-Earth could this phenomenon occur.  The fact of the matter is that the Law of Perspective on plane surfaces dictates and necessitates the exact same occurrence.  For example a girl wearing a dress walking away towards the horizon will appear to sink into the Earth the farther away she walks.  Her feet will disappear from view first and the distance between the ground and the bottom of her dress will gradually diminish until after about half a mile it seems like her dress is touching the ground as she walks on invisible legs.  Such is the case on plane surfaces, the lowest parts of objects receding from a given point of observation necessarily disappear before the highest. 139)  Not only is the disappearance of ship’s hulls explained by the Law of Perspective on flat surfaces, it is proven undeniably true with the aid of a good telescope.  If you watch a ship sailing away into the horizon with the naked eye until its hull has completely disappeared from view under the supposed “curvature of the Earth,” then look through a telescope, you will notice the entire ship quickly zooms back into view, hull and all, proving that the disappearance was caused by the Law of Perspective, not by a wall of curved water!  This also proves that the horizon is simply the vanishing line of perspective from your point of view, NOT the alleged “curvature” of Earth. 140)  Foucault’s Pendulums are often quoted as proof of a rotating Earth but upon closer investigation prove the opposite.  To begin with, Foucault’s pendulums do not uniformly swing in any one direction.  Sometimes they rotate clockwise and sometimes counter-clockwise, sometimes they fail to rotate and sometimes they rotate far too much.  The behavior of the pendulum actually depends on 1) the initial force beginning its swing and, 2) the ball-and-socket joint used which most-readily facilitates circular motion over any other.  The supposed rotation of the Earth is completely inconsequential and irrelevant to the pendulum’s swing.  If the alleged constant rotation of the Earth affected pendulums in any way, then there should be no need to manually start pendulums in motion.  If the Earth’s diurnal rotation caused the 360 degree uniform diurnal rotation of pendulums, then there should not exist a stationary pendulum anywhere on Earth! 141)  The “Coriolis Effect” is often said to cause sinks and toilet bowls in the Northern Hemisphere to drain spinning in one direction while in the Southern Hemisphere causing them to spin the opposite way, thus providing proof of the spinning ball-Earth.  Once again, however, just like Foucault’s Pendulums spinning either which way, sinks and toilets in the Northern and Southern hemispheres do not consistently spin in any one direction!  Sinks and toilets in the very same household are often found to spin opposite directions, depending entirely upon the shape of the basin and the angle of the water’s entry, not the supposed rotation of the Earth. 142)  People claim that if the Earth were flat, they should be able to use a telescope and see clear across the oceans!  This is absurd, however, as the air is full of precipitation especially over the oceans, and especially at the lowest, densest layer of atmosphere is NOT transparent.  Picture the blurry haze over roads on hot, humid days.  Even the best telescope will blur out long before you could see across an ocean.  You can, however, use a telescope to zoom in MUCH more of our flat Earth than would be possible on a ball 25,000 miles in circumference. 143)  People claim that if the Earth were flat, with the Sun circling over and around us, we should be able to see the Sun from everywhere all over the Earth, and there should be daylight even at night-time.  Since the Sun is NOT 93 million miles away but rather just a few thousand and shining down like a spotlight, once it has moved significantly far enough away from your location it becomes invisible beyond the horizon and daylight slowly fades until it completely disappears.  If the Sun were 93 million miles away and the Earth a spinning ball, the transition from daylight to night would instead be almost instantaneous as you passed the terminator line. 144)  Pictures of the Moon appearing upside-down in the Southern hemisphere and right-side up in the North are often cited as proof of the ball-Earth, but once again, upon closer inspection, provide another proof of the flat model.  In fact, time-lapse photography shows the Moon itself turns clockwise like a wheel as it circles over and around the Earth.  You can find pictures of the Moon at 360 degrees of various inclination from all over the Earth simply depending on where and when the picture was taken. 145)  Heliocentrists believe the Moon is a ball, even though its appearance is clearly that of a flat luminous disc.  We only ever see the same one face (albeit at various inclinations) of the Moon, yet it is claimed that there is another “dark side of the Moon” which remains hidden.  NASA states the Moon spins opposite the spin of the Earth in such a perfectly synchronized way that the motions cancel each other out so we will conveniently never be able to observe the supposed dark-side of the Moon outside of their terrible fake CGI images.  The fact of the matter is, however, if the Moon were a sphere, observers in Antarctica would see a different face from those at the equator, yet they do not – just the same flat face rotated at various degrees. 146)  The ball-Earth model claims the Moon orbits around the Earth once every 28 days, yet it is plain for anyone to see that the Moon orbits around the Earth every single day!  The Moon’s orbit is slightly slower than the Sun’s, but follows the Sun’s same path from Tropic to Tropic, solstice to solstice, making a full circle over the Earth in just under 25 hours. 147)  The ball-Earth model claims the Sun is precisely 400 times larger than the Moon and 400 times further away from Earth making them “falsely” appear exactly the same size.  Once again, the ball model asks us to accept as coincidence something that cannot be explained other than by natural design.  The Sun and the Moon occupy the same amount of space in the sky and have been measured with sextants to be of equal size and equal distance, so claiming otherwise is against our eyes, experience, experiments and common sense. 148)  Quoting “Earth Not a Globe!” by Samuel Rowbotham, “It is found by observation that the stars come to the meridian about four minutes earlier every twenty-four hours than the sun, taking the solar time as the standard. This makes 120 minutes every thirty days, and twenty-four hours in the year. Hence all the constellations have passed before or in advance of the sun in that time. This is the simple fact as observed in nature, but the theory of rotundity and motion on axes and in an orbit has no place for it. Visible truth must be ignored, because this theory stands in the way, and prevents its votaries from understanding it.” 149)  Throughout thousands of years the same constellations have remained fixed in their same patterns without moving out of position whatsoever.  If the Earth were a big ball spinning around a bigger Sun spinning around a bigger galaxy shooting off from the Biggest Bang as NASA claims, it is impossible that the constellations would remain so fixed.  Based on their model, we should, in fact, have an entirely different night sky every single night and never repeat exactly the same star pattern twice. 150)  If Earth were a spinning ball it would be impossible to photograph star-trail time-lapses turning perfect circles around Polaris anywhere but the North Pole.  At all other vantage points the stars would be seen to travel more or less horizontally across the observer’s horizon due to the alleged 1000mph motion beneath their feet.  In reality, however, Polaris’s surrounding stars can always be photographed turning perfect circles around the central star all the way down to the Tropic of Capricorn. 151)  If Earth were a spinning ball revolving around the Sun it would actually be impossible for star-trail photos to show perfect circles even at the North Pole!  Since the Earth is also allegedly moving 67,000mph around the Sun, the Sun moving 500,000mph around the Milky Way, and the entire galaxy going 670,000,000mph, these four contradictory motions would make star-trail time-lapses all show irregular curved lines. 152)  In 2003, three University Geography professors collaborated in an experiment to prove that the state of Kansas is indeed actually flatter than a pancake!  Using topigraphical geodetic surveys covering over 80,000 square miles it was determined that Kansas has a flatness ratio of 0.9997 over the entire state while the average pancake, precisely measured using a confocal laser microscope comes in at 0.957, making Kansas thereby literally flatter than a pancake. 153)  Quoting Reverend Thomas Milner’s “Atlas of Physical Geography,” we find that, “Vast areas exhibit a perfectly dead level, scarcely a rise existing through 1,500 miles from the Carpathians to the Urals.  South of the Baltic the country is so flat that a prevailing north wind will drive the waters of the Stattiner Haf into the mouth of the Oder, and give the river a backward flow 30 or 40 miles.  The plains of Venezuela and New Granada, in South America chiefly on the left of the Orinoco, are termed Ilanos, or level fields.  Often in the space of 270 square miles the surface does not vary a single foot.  The Amazon only falls 12 feet in the last 700 miles of its course; the La Plata has only a descent of one thirty-third of an inch a mile.” 154)  The Felix Baumgartner Red Bull dive outside camera shows the same amount of “curvature of Earth” from surface-level to jump-height proving it to be a deceiving fish-eyed wide-angle lens, while the inside regular camera shows a perfectly flat horizon, eye level at 128,000 feet, which is only consistent with a flat plane. 155)  Some people claim to have seen the curvature of the Earth out their airplane windows.  The glass used in all commercial airplanes, however, is curved to remain flush with the fuselage. This creates a slight effect mixed with confirmation bias people mistake for being the alleged curvature of the Earth. In actuality, the fact that you can see the horizon at eye-level at 35,000 feet out both port/starboard windows proves the Earth is flat.  If the Earth were a ball, no matter how big, the horizon would stay exactly where it was and you would have to look DOWN further and further to see the horizon at all. Looking straight out the window at 35,000 feet you should see nothing but ""outer-space"" from the port and starboard windows, as the Earth/horizon are supposed to be BELOW you. If they are visible at eye level outside both side windows, it’s because the Earth is flat! 156)  People also claim to see curvature in Go Pro or other high altitude camera footage of the horizon.  While it is true that the horizon often appears convex in such footage, it just as often appears concave or flat depending on the tilt/movement of the camera.  The effect is simply a distortion due to wide-angle lenses.  In lens-corrected and footage taken without wide-angle technology, all amateur high-altitude horizon shots appear perfectly flat. 157)  If “gravity” magically dragged the atmosphere along with the spinning ball Earth, that would mean the atmosphere near the equator would be spinning around at over 1000mph, the atmosphere over the mid-latitudes would be spinning around 500mph, and gradually slower down to the poles where the atmosphere would be unaffected at 0mph.  In reality, however, the atmosphere at every point on Earth is equally unaffected by this alleged force, as it has never been measured or calculated and proven non-existent by the ability of airplanes to fly unabated in any direction without experiencing any such atmospheric changes. 158)  If “gravity” magically dragged the atmosphere along with the spinning ball Earth, that would mean the higher the altitude, the faster the spinning atmosphere would have to be turning around the center of rotation.  In reality, however, if this were happening then rain and fireworks would behave entirely differently as they fell down through progressively slower and slower spinning atmosphere.  Hot-air balloons would also be forced steadily faster Eastwards as they ascended through the ever increasing atmospheric speeds. 159)  If there were progressively faster and faster spinning atmosphere the higher the altitude that would mean it would have to abruptly end at some key altitude where the fastest layer of gravitized spinning atmosphere meets the supposed non-gravitized non-spinning non-atmosphere of infinite vacuum space!  NASA has never mentioned what altitude this impossible feat allegedly happens, but it is easily philosophically refuted by the simple fact that vacuums cannot exist connected to non-vacuums while maintaining the properties of a vacuum – not to mention, the effect such a transition would have on a rocket “space ship” would be disastrous. 160)  It is impossible for rockets or any type of jet propulsion engines to work in the alleged non-atmosphere of vacuum space because without air/atmosphere to push against there is nothing to propel the vehicle forwards.  Instead the rockets and shuttles would be sent spinning around their own axis uncontrollably in all directions like a gyroscope.  It would be impossible to fly to the Moon or go in any direction whatsoever, especially if “gravity” were real and constantly sucking you towards the closest densest body. 161)  If Earth were really a ball, there would be no reason to use rockets for flying into “outer-space” anyway because simply flying an airplane straight at any altitude for long enough should and would send you off into outer-space.  To prevent their airplanes from flying tangent to the ball-Earth, pilots would have to constantly course-correct downwards, or else within just a few hours the average commercial airliner traveling 500mph would find themselves lost in “outer-space.”  The fact that this never happens, artificial horizons remain level at pilot’s desired altitudes and do NOT require constant downwards adjustments, proves the Earth is not a ball. 162)  All NASA and other “space agencies” rocket launches never go straight up.  Every rocket forms a parabolic curve, peaks out, and inevitably starts falling back to Earth.  The rockets which are declared “successful” are those few which don’t explode or start falling too soon but make it out of range of spectator view before crashing down into restricted waters and recovered.  There is no magic altitude where rockets or anything else can simply go up, up, up and then suddenly just start “free-floating” in space.  This is all a science-fiction illusion created by wires, green-screens, dark pools, some permed hair and Zero-G planes. 163)  NASA and other space agencies have been caught time and again with air bubbles forming and floating off in their official “outer-space” footage.  Astronauts have also been caught using scuba-space-gear, kicking their legs to move, and astronaut Luca Parmitano even almost drowned when water started filling up his helmet while allegedly on a “space-walk.”  It is admitted that astronauts train for their “space-walks” in under-water training facilities like NASA’s “Neutral Buoyancy Lab,” but what is obvious from their “space bubbles,” and other blunders is that all official “space-walk” footage is also fake and filmed under-water. 164)  Analysis of many interior videos from the “International Space Station,” have shown the use of camera-tricks such as green-screens, harnesses and even wildly permed hair to achieve a zero-gravity type effect.  Footage of astronauts seemingly floating in the zero-gravity of their “space station” is indistinguishable from “vomit comet” Zero-G airplane footage.  By flying parabolic maneuvers this Zero-G floating effect can be achieved over and over again then edited together.  For longer uncut shots, NASA has been caught using simple wires and green screen technology. 165)  NASA claims one can observe the International Space Station pass by overhead proving its existence, yet analysis of the “ISS” seen through zoom cameras proves it to be some type of hologram/drone, not a physical floating space-base.  As you can see in my documentary “ISS Hoax,” when zooming in/out, the “ISS” dramatically and impossibly changes shape and color, displaying a prismatic rainbow effect until coming into focus much like an old television turning on/off. 166)  The “geostationary communications satellite” was first created by Freemason science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke and supposedly became science-fact just a decade later.  Before this, radio, television, and navigation systems like LORAN and DECCA were already well-established and worked fine using only ground-based technologies.  Nowadays huge fibre-optics cables connect the internet across oceans, gigantic cell towers triangulate GPS signals, and ionospheric propagation allows radio waves to be bounced all without the aid of the science-fiction best-seller known as “satellites.” 167)  Satellites are allegedly floating around in the thermosphere where temperatures are claimed to be upwards of 4,530 degrees Fahrenheit.  The metals used in satellites, however, such as aluminum, gold and titanium have melting points of 1,221, 1,948, and 3,034 degrees respectively, all far lower than they could possibly handle. 168)  So-called “satellite” phones have been found to have reception problems in countries like Kazakhstan with very few cell phone towers.  If the Earth were a ball with 20,000+ satellites surrounding, such blackouts should not regularly occur in any rural countryside areas. 169)  So-called “satellite” TV dishes are almost always positioned at a 45 degree angle towards the nearest ground-based repeater tower.  If TV antennae were actually picking up signals from satellites 100+ miles in space, most TV dishes should be pointing more or less straight up to the sky.  The fact that “satellite” dishes are never pointing straight up and almost always positioned at a 45 degree angle proves they are picking up ground-based tower signals and not “outer-space satellites.” 170)  People even claim to see satellites with their naked eyes, but this is ridiculous considering they are smaller than a bus and allegedly 100+ miles away;  It is impossible to see anything so small that far away.  Even using telescopes, no one claims to discern the shape of satellites but rather describes seeing passing moving lights, which could easily be any number of things from airplanes to drones to shooting stars or other unidentified flying objects. 171)  NASA claims there are upwards of 20,000 satellites floating around Earth’s upper-atmosphere sending us radio, television, GPS, and taking pictures of the planet.  All these supposed satellite pictures, however, are admittedly “composite images, edited in photoshop!”  They claim to receive “ribbons of imagery” from satellites which must then be spliced together to create composite images of the Earth, all of which are clearly CGI and not photographs.  If Earth were truly a ball with 20,000 satellites orbiting, it would be a simple matter to mount a camera and take some real photographs.  The fact that no real satellite photographs of the supposed ball Earth exist in favor of NASA’s “ribbons of composite CG imagery,” is further proof we are not being told the truth. 172)  If you pick any cloud in the sky and watch for several minutes, two things will happen: the clouds will move and they will morph gradually changing shape.  In official NASA footage of the spinning ball Earth, such as the “Galileo” time-lapse video however, clouds are constantly shown for 24+ hours at a time and not moving or morphing whatsoever!  This is completely impossible, further proof that NASA produces fake CGI videos, and further evidence that Earth is not a spinning ball. 173)  NASA has several alleged photographs of the ball-Earth which show several exact duplicate cloud patterns!  The likelihood of having two or three clouds of the exact same shape in the same picture is as likely as finding two or three people with exactly the same fingerprints.  In fact it is solid proof that the clouds were copied and pasted in a computer program and that such pictures showing a ball-shaped Earth are fakes. 174)   NASA graphics artists have placed things like faces, dragons, and even the word “SEX” into cloud patterns over their various ball-Earth pictures.  Their recent 2015 Pluto pictures even clearly have a picture of Disney’s “Pluto” the dog layered into the background.  Such blatant fraud goes unnoticed by the hypnotized masses, but provides further proof of the illegitimacy of NASA and their spinning ball planet mythos. 175)  Professional photo-analysts have dissected several NASA images of the ball-Earth and found undeniable proof of computer editing.  For example, images of the Earth allegedly taken from the Moon have proven to be copied and pasted in, as evidenced by rectangular cuts found in the black background around the “Earth” by adjusting brightness and contrast levels.  If they were truly on the Moon and Earth was truly a ball, there would be no need to fake such pictures. 176)  When NASA’s images of the ball-Earth are compared with one another the coloration of the land/oceans and relative size of the continents are consistently so drastically different from one another as to prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the pictures are all fake. 177)  In the documentary “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon,” you can watch official leaked NASA footage showing Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins, for almost an hour, using transparencies and camera-tricks to fake shots of a round Earth!  They communicate over audio with control in Houston about how to accurately stage the shot, and someone keeps prompting them on how to effectively manipulate the camera to achieve the desired effect.  First, they blacked out all the windows except for a downward facing circular one, which they aimed the camera towards from several feet away.  This created the illusion of a ball-shaped Earth surrounded by the blackness of space, when in fact it was simply a round window in their dark cabin.  Neil Armstrong claimed at this point to be 130,000 miles from Earth, half-way to the Moon, but when camera-tricks were finished the viewer could see for themselves the astro-nots were not more than a couple dozen miles above the Earth’s surface, likely flying in a high-altitude plane! 178)  People claim Google Earth somehow proves the ball model without realizing that Google Earth is simply a composite program of images taken from high-altitude planes and street-level car-cameras superimposed onto a CGI model of a ball Earth.  The same could be just as easily modeled onto a square Earth or any other shape and therefore cannot be used as proof of Earth’s rotundity. 179)  If the Earth were constantly spinning Eastwards 1000mph then airplane flight durations going Eastwards vs. Westwards should be significantly different.  If the average commercial airliner travels 500mph, it follows that Westbound equatorial flights should reach their destination at approximately thrice the speed as their Eastbound return flights.  In reality, however, the differences in East/Westbound flight durations usually amount to a matter of minutes, and nothing near what would occur on a 1000mph spinning ball Earth. 180)  The spinning ball model dictates that the Earth and atmosphere would be moving together at approximately 500mph at the mid-latitudes where an LA to NYC flight takes place.  The average commercial airliner traveling 500mph takes 5.5 hours traveling East with the alleged rotation of the Earth, so the return flight West should take only 2.75 hours, but in fact we find the average NYC to LA flight takes 6 hours, a flight time totally inconsistent with the spinning ball model. 181)  Flights Eastwards with the alleged spin of the ball-Earth from Tokyo to LA take an average of 10.5 hours, therefore the return flights Westwards against the alleged spin should take an average of 5.25 hours, but in actual fact take an average of 11.5 hours, another flight time totally inconsistent with the spinning ball model. 182)  Flights Eastwards with the alleged spin of the ball-Earth from NY to London take an average of 7 hours, therefore the return flights Westwards against the alleged spin should take an average of 3.5 hours, but in actual fact take an average of 7.5 hours, a flight time totally inconsistent with the spinning ball model. 183)  Flights Eastwards from Chicago to Boston with the alleged spin of the ball-Earth take an average of 2.25 hours, therefore the return flights Westwards against the alleged spin should take an average of just over an hour, but in actual fact take an average of 2.75 hours, once again, completely inconsistent with the spinning ball model. 184)  Flights Eastwards from Paris to Rome with the alleged spin of the ball-Earth take an average of 2 hours, therefore the return flights Westwards against the alleged spin should take an average of 1 hour, but in actual fact have an average flight duration of 2 hours 10 minutes, a flight time totally inconsistent with the spinning ball model. 185)  We are told that the Earth and atmosphere spin together at such a perfect uniform velocity that no one in history has ever seen, heard, felt or measured the supposed 1000mph movement.  This is then often compared to traveling in a car at uniform velocity, where we only feel the movement during acceleration or deceleration.  In reality, however, even with eyes closed, windows up, over smooth tar in a luxury car at a mere uniform 50mph, the movement absolutely can be felt!  At 20 times this speed, Earth’s imaginary 1000mph spin would most certainly be noticeable, felt, seen and heard by all. 186)  People sensitive to motion sickness feel distinct unease and physical discomfort from motion as slight as an elevator or a train ride.  This means that the 1000mph alleged uniform spin of the Earth has no effect on such people, but add an extra 50mph uniform velocity of a car and their stomach starts turning knots.  The idea that motion sickness is nowhere apparent in anyone at 1000mph, but suddenly comes about at 1050mph is ridiculous and proves the Earth is not in motion whatsoever. 187)  The second law of thermodynamics, otherwise known as the law of entropy, along with the fundamental principles of friction/resistance determine the impossibility of Earth being a uniformly spinning ball.  Over time, the spinning ball Earth would experience measurable amounts of drag constantly slowing the spin and lengthening the amount of hours per day.  As not the slightest such change has ever been observed in all of recorded history it is absurd to assume the Earth has ever moved an inch. 188)  Over the years NASA has twice changed their story regarding the shape of the Earth.  At first they maintained Earth was a perfect sphere, which later changed to an “oblate spheroid” flattened at the poles, and then changed again to being “pear-shaped” as the Southern hemisphere allegedly bulges out as well.  Unfortunately for NASA, however, none of their official pictures show an oblate spheroid or pear-shaped Earth!  All their pictures, contrary to their words, show a spherical (and clearly CGI fake) Earth. 189)  The Bible, Koran, Srimad Bhagavatam, and many other holy books describe and purport the existence of a geocentric, stationary flat Earth.  For example, 1 Chronicles 16:30 and Psalm 96:10 both read, “He has fixed the earth firm, immovable.”  And Psalm 93:1 says, “The world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.”  The Bible also repeatedly affirms that the Earth is “outstretched” as a plane, with the outstretched heavens everywhere above (not all around) giving a scriptural proof the Earth is not a spinning ball. 190)  Cultures the world over throughout history have all described and purported the existence of a geocentric, stationary flat Earth.  Egyptians, Indians, Mayans, Chinese, Native Americans and literally every ancient civilization on Earth had a geocentric flat-Earth cosmology.  Before Pythagoras, the idea of a spinning ball-Earth was non-existent and even after Pythagoras it remained an obscure minority view until 2000 years later when Copernicus began reviving the heliocentric theory. 191)  From Pythagoras to Copernicus, Galileo and Newton, to modern astronauts like Aldrin, Armstrong and Collins, to director of NASA and Grand Commander of the 33rd degree C. Fred Kleinknecht, the founding fathers of the spinning ball mythos have all been Freemasons!  The fact that so many members of this, the largest and oldest secret society in existence have all been co-conspirators bringing about this literal “planetary revolution” is beyond the possibility of coincidence and provides proof of organized collusion in creating and maintaining this multi-generational deception. 192)  Quoting “Terra Firma” by David Wardlaw Scott, “The system of the Universe, as taught by Modern Astronomers, being founded entirely on theory, for the truth of which they are unable to advance one single real proof, they have entrenched themselves in a conspiracy of silence, and decline to answer any objections which may be made to their hypotheses … Copernicus himself, who revived the theory of the heathen philosopher Pythagoras, and his great exponent Sir Isaac Newton, confessed that their system of a revolving Earth was only a possibility, and could not be proved by facts. It is only their followers who have decorated it with the name of an ‘exact science,’ yea, according to them, ‘the most exact of all the sciences.’  Yet one Astronomer Royal for England once said, speaking of the motion of the whole Solar system: ‘The matter is left in a most delightful state of uncertainty, and I shall be very glad if any one can help me out of it.’ What a very sad position for an ‘exact science’ to be in is this!” 193)  No child or un-indoctrinated man in their right-mind would ever conclude or even conceive given to their own devices, based on their own personal observations, that the Earth was a spinning ball revolving around the Sun!  Such imaginative theories nowhere present in anyone’s daily experience require and have required massive amounts of constant propaganda to uphold the illusion. 194)  From David Wardlaw Scott, “I remember being taught when a boy, that the Earth was a great ball, revolving at a very rapid rate around the Sun, and, when I expressed to my teacher my fears that the waters of the oceans would tumble off, I was told that they were prevented from doing so by Newton’s great law of Gravitation, which kept everything in its proper place.  I presume that my countenance must have shown some signs of incredulity, for my teacher immediately added - I can show you a direct proof of this; a man can whirl around his head a pail filled with water without its being spilt, and so, in like manner, can the oceans be carried round the Sun without losing a drop.  As this illustration was evidently intended to settle the matter, I then said no more upon the subject.  Had such been proposed to me afterwards as a man, I would have answered somewhat as follows - Sir, I beg to say that the illustration you have given of a man whirling a pail of water round his head, and the oceans revolving round the Sun, does not in any degree confirm your argument, because the water in the two cases is placed under entirely different circumstances, but, to be of any value, the conditions in each case must be the same, which here they are not.  The pail is a hollow vessel which holds the water inside it, whereas, according to your teaching, the Earth is a ball, with a continuous curvature outside, which, in agreement with the laws of nature, could not retain any water.” 195)  Astronomers say the magical magnetism of gravity is what keeps all the oceans of the world stuck to the ball-Earth.  They claim that because the Earth is so massive, by virtue of this mass it creates a magic force able to hold people, oceans and atmosphere tightly clung to the underside of the spinning ball.  Unfortunately, however, they cannot provide any practical example of this on a scale smaller than the planetary.  A spinning wet tennis ball, for instance, has the exact opposite effect of the supposed ball-Earth! Any water poured over it simply falls off the sides, and giving it a spin results in water flying off 360 degrees like a dog shaking after a bath.  Astronomers concede the wet tennis ball example displays the opposite effect of their supposed ball-Earth, but claim that at some unknown mass, the magic adhesive properties of gravity suddenly kick in allowing the spinning wet tennis ball-Earth to keep every drop of “gravitized” water stuck to the surface.  When such an unproven theory goes against all experiments, experience and common sense, it is high time to drop the theory. 196)  Quoting Marshall Hall, “In short, the sun, moon, and stars are actually doing precisely what everyone throughout all history has seen them do. We do not believe what our eyes tell us because we have been taught a counterfeit system which demands that we believe what has never been confirmed by observation or experiment. That counterfeit system demands that the Earth rotate on an 'axis' every 24 hours at a speed of over 1000 MPH at the equator. No one has ever, ever, ever seen or felt such movement (nor seen or felt the 67,000MPH speed of the Earth's alleged orbit around the sun or its 500,000 MPH alleged speed around a galaxy or its retreat from an alleged 'Big Bang' at over 670,000,000 MPH!). Remember, no experiment has ever shown the earth to be moving. Add to that the fact that the alleged rotational speed we've all been taught as scientific fact MUST decrease every inch or mile one goes north or south of the equator, and it becomes readily apparent that such things as accurate aerial bombing in WWII (down a chimney from 25,000 feet with a plane going any direction at high speed) would have been impossible if calculated on an earth moving below at several hundred MPH and changing constantly with the latitude."" 197)  Some people claim there is no motive for such a grand-scale deception and that flat or a ball makes no difference.  By removing Earth from the motionless center of the Universe, these Masons have moved us physically and metaphysically from a place of supreme importance to one of complete nihilistic indifference. If the Earth is the center of the Universe, then the ideas of God, creation, and a purpose for human existence are resplendent. But if the Earth is just one of billions of planets revolving around billions of stars in billions of galaxies, then the ideas of God, creation, and a specific purpose for Earth and human existence become highly implausible.  By surreptitiously indoctrinating us into their scientific materialist Sun-worship, not only do we lose faith in anything beyond the material, we gain absolute faith in materiality, superficiality, status, selfishness, hedonism and consumerism.  If there is no God, and everyone is just an accident, then all that really matters is me, me, me.  They have turned Madonna, the Mother of God, into a material girl living in a material world.  Their rich, powerful corporations with slick Sun-cult logos sell us idols to worship, slowly taking over the world while we tacitly believe their “science,” vote for their politicians, buy their products, listen to their music, and watch their movies, sacrificing our souls at the altar of materialism.  To quote Morris Kline, “The heliocentric theory, by putting the sun at the center of the universe ... made man appear to be just one of a possible host of wanderers drifting through a cold sky. It seemed less likely that he was born to live gloriously and to attain paradise upon his death. Less likely, too, was it that he was the object of God’s ministrations.” 198)  Some say the idea of an inter-generational world-wide conspiracy to delude the masses sounds implausible or unrealistic, but these people need only familiarize themselves with the works and writings of Freemasons themselves, for example John Robison who exposed this in his 1798 book, “Proofs of a Conspiracy Against All the Religions and Governments of Europe Carried Out in the Secret Meetings of the Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies.”  Supreme Commander of the 33rd degree Albert Pike was quite forth-coming in several letters regarding the Masons ultimate goal of world domination, and in the Zionist “Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion” the exact plan by which this would be and has been carried out is completely disclosed. 199)  From “Foundations of Many Generations” by E. Eschini, “The one thing the fable of the revolving Earth has done, it has shown the terrible power of a lie, a lie has the power to make a man a mental slave, so that he dares not back the evidence of his own senses.  To deny the plain and obvious movement of the Sun he sees before him.  When he feels himself standing on an Earth utterly devoid of motion, at the suggestion of someone else he is prepared to accept that he is spinning furiously round.  When he sees a bird flying, and gaining over the ground, he is prepared to believe that the ground is really travelling a great number of times faster than the bird, finally, in order to uphold the imagination of a madman, he is prepared to accuse his Maker of forming him a sensiferous lie.” 200)  And finally, from Dr. Rowbotham, “Thus we see that this Newtonian philosophy is devoid of consistency; its details are the result of an entire violation of the laws of legitimate reasoning, and all its premises are assumed. It is, in fact, nothing more than assumption upon assumption, and the conclusions derived therefrom are willfully considered as things proved, and to be employed as truths to substantiate the first and fundamental assumptions. Such a ‘juggle and jumble’ of fancies and falsehoods extended and intensified as in theoretical astronomy is calculated to make the unprejudiced inquirer revolt with horror from the terrible conjuration which has been practised upon him; to sternly resolve to resist its further progress; to endeavour to over-throw the entire edifice, and to bury in its ruins the false honours which have been associated with its fabricators, and which still attach to its devotees. For the learning, the patience, the perseverance and devotion for which they have ever been examples, honour and applause need not be withheld; but their false reasoning, the advantages they have taken of the general ignorance of mankind in respect to astronomical subjects, and the unfounded theories they have advanced and defended, cannot be otherwise than regretted, and ought to be by every possible means uprooted.”"
54,Flat Earth Shill Wall of Shame,"Google analytics shows that since November 2014, the search term ""Flat Earth"" has enjoyed an incredible and never before seen 600% rise in activity!  The reason behind the sudden and sharp increase for this key-word is undeniably the publishing of which were both released in November 2014.  The Flat Earth Conspiracy was the first pro-flat Earth book written in almost 50 years and is rapidly becoming an under-ground best-seller while my documentary, interviews and other flat Earth videos have received a combined 1,000,000+ views and growing.  As you can imagine, when exposing a 500 year running conspiracy involving NASA, the U.N. and world Freemasonry, there will be death threats (which I'm receiving regularly) and controlled opposition agents will be sent in to infiltrate and co-opt the growing movement.  I'm writing this article to expose the evidence I've compiled that several such government shills are currently hard at work doing just that. About six weeks after my flat Earth book, videos and articles started going viral, this character showed up on YouTube making a series of well-presented ""Flat Earth Clues"" videos, uploading a new one every day.  Next he started getting several radio interviews per week, got his very own radio show, and even went on Coast 2 Coast AM all in the name of exposing his ""Flat Earth Clues.""  These ""clues,"" however, instead of revealing actual scientific evidence/experiments which prove the Earth to be flat like myself and all genuine flat Earthers do, Mark's ""clues"" are always merely his personal speculations.  For example Mark's first ""Flat Earth Clue"" is that Hollywood hasn't really made many movies about the Moon landings, and this gives him a raging clue that Apollo was fake and Earth is flat.  His second clue was claiming with no evidence whatsoever that Freemason Admiral Byrd had reached the ""dome."" The unfounded claims only got more ridiculous as Mark began doing radio interviews.  Suddenly he began saying that ""the Moon and stars are ,"" and recommending at least once per show that everyone must visit fellow shill Crrow777's YouTube channel. (of which he is still a member, but refuses to post) giving abundant evidence that the Moon/stars are natural luminaries and NOT holographic projections, to which he responded only once and did so not personally, but through another fellow shill, Acenci.  Acenci relayed Mark's message which said, "" .""  And herein lies Mark's method of muddying the waters of truth and poisoning the flat Earth well.  Everything he has to say on the flat Earth subject is based on ""his model""; not science, evidence, experiments, proof, or reason, but rather what he thinks works best from ""a game design standpoint"" (because he used to be a video game designer). So he claims without evidence the celestial bodies are ""projections""; He claims without evidence that Admiral Byrd reached the ""dome""; He also claims without evidence that heat is NOT caused by the Sun (in his model) but by unknown processes underneath the flat Earth!; He has claimed more than once that ""gravity is something we can prove obviously exists"" when all genuine flat Earthers know , has never been proven, and is just density; He even recently introduced his own untested theory of ""molecular magnetism"" to explain gravity in his ""enclosed flat model."" In interviews Mark regularly lies about me saying things like ""Eric thinks the Moon is 
2-dimensional while (he) thinks it is 3-dimensional,"" when the truth is 
that I have always said the Moon is a .  He claims ""Eric 
considers himself a flat Earth purist"" another lie I've never said, nor 
do I even understand what a ""Flat Earth purist"" is supposed to be.  In one interview Mark had the 
audacity to lie and claim that I purport that the Flat Earth 
disc is constantly rising to account for gravity when I have exposed in 
my articles/interviews repeatedly that this is a FALSE Flat Earth argument put 
forward by the In early interviews Mark claimed to have read SOME of my book, but when cornered in later interviews claimed to have NOT read my book; He constantly promotes the Orlando Ferguson CONCAVE Earth map as being 
""one of the best flat Earth maps,"" when it is clearly one of the worst; He mentioned in one interview the shillspicious fact that he worked in ""internet data-mining for 3 years""; and he constantly plays with a 
toy globe affront the camera in every interview subconsciously 
re-enforcing the globe model while talking non-sense about the Flat 
Earth. to please stop 
doing this and he AGREED and PROMISED to stop, but then in his very next
 interview and many since then he has broken his promise and continued 
to play with his little ball Earth. , after 50 minutes of speculative ""evidence"" from ""every ancient myth he's found"" Dan asked ""is there any other proof the Earth isn't spinning other 
than these ancient texts?"" At which point Mark made the 
shilliest statement of his career claiming after a 5 second pause and 
long exhale, ""If there was, I think we'd probably know it at this 
point!"" and nervously annoyingly laughs as he does every time an 
interviewer asks him a straight-forward question.  Claiming to know 
of NO EVIDENCE/PROOF the Earth isn't spinning other than ancient texts is ludicrous, disingenuous, and proves Mark has no business in the flat Earth movement.  In the same interview he also lied that 
""he's been trying to patch things up with Eric,"" when he then and still 
to this day refuses to engage in a dialogue with me, and has refused to accept my challenge to debate him on Patricia Aiken's show. Mark came right out and said: (paraphrasing) ""I'm not even that attached to the flat model, everyone 
has their models with good/bad points, I have my model, Eric has his 
model, and even Lord Steven Christ has his model which is a lot better 
than the ball Earth model! At this point, I'm just sure it's not a ball,
 other than that is open to speculation.""  What kind of confidence does it instill in listeners when this supposed ""leader"" 
of the Flat Earth movement ""isn't even sure the Earth is flat!? Right after starting my IFERS (International Flat Earth Research Society) Forum, my ""biggest fan"" and most enthusiastic and prolific poster was one ""Andrea Cenci,"" allegedly an Italian banker who watched my Flat Earth Conspiracy Documentary and was instantly converted to a flat Earther.  He subsequently divided his time between sucking up to me, dismissing the shilliness of his friend Mark Sargent, creating sock accounts to like and agree with himself, and otherwise filling the forum with useless content as per .  When his constant defense of Mark Sargent became unbearable, his sock accounts discovered, and he started making paranoid rants about us needing to shut down the IFERS forum for fear of our lives, Acenci (and his other multiple personalities) were banned.  To everyone's surprise and amusement, however, Acenci and all his sock puppets quickly created their own forum from where they obsessively attempted to infiltrate, criticize, and denounce IFERS, its posts, its members, and especially its leaders/management.  He and his multiple personalities then went on to create and participate in 3 further failed forums, all dedicated to trashing IFERS.  You can see .  It has now been over 5 months and Acenci is still online all day every day obsessively cataloging, re-posting and analyzing/criticizing every aspect of the IFERS community.  He has even paid to have several banners advertizing his forums appear on IFERS. Before writing my book I noticed this ridiculous shill on YouTube sporting a Masonic logo and claiming to be the reincarnation of Jesus Christ.  He states with little to no evidence, but very high-end 3D graphics models, that the Earth is neither flat nor convex, but rather it is concave!  He and the other leading ""concave Earther"" Wild Heretic give , 3 of which come straight from flat Earther Samuel Rowbotham's book!  Compare this with flat Earther William Carpenter's 100 Proofs the Earth is Not a Globe, or my book with over 200 proofs of the flat Earth, and it becomes apparent how laughable these ""concave Earth theorists"" are.  I noticed he and his cohorts trolling every flat Earth channel threatening to flag their videos and ""report them to the NSA,"" and true to form, once I began making flat Earth videos he did the same to me, claiming he'd report me to the NSA and that ""I'd better repent"" because I was ""living inside His concave Earth"" (remember, he thinks he's Jesus).  Since then I have had the ""divine"" honor of having ""Our Lord and Savior Steven Christ"" devote be on the subject of ""debunking"" and denouncing me and my work.  Steven has also joined Acenci's shill forums and like Acenci, paid for banner ads on IFERS (which I have no control over) promoting his ""Concave Earth"" Forum. When looking for clips to use in The Flat Earth Conspiracy Documentary, I came across this guy with a very enigmatic voice and a couple decent videos disputing the alleged curvature of the ball Earth.  After deciding to include them, Zhib's channel took a turn for the worse and he began making non-sense videos claiming, much like Mark Sargent, to have his very own flat model which he thought to be more accurate than the generally accepted azimuthal equidistant flat Earth model.  In his model, Antarctica was actually the North Pole!  All the continents are flipped completely upside down!  And Polaris, instead of being motionless above the North Pole, revolves around the outside perimeter of the flat Earth!  Again, just like Mark Sargent, Zhib doesn't even feign having any practical evidence for these outrageous and easily disproven claims.  Zhib instead states his wisdom came from ""God"" and he repeats over and over in every video that ""Jesus Christ is the only truth man will ever know.""  In a recent, even shillier turn of events, Zhib has that mixes truth with lies and satire to discredit genuine flat 
Earth research, a job they have been doing for a long time now.  Founded
 in 1970 by Leo Ferrari, a suspected Freemason and philosophy professor 
at St. Thomas' University, Leo spent his life making a mockery of the .  Leo would always take a pumpkin-sized rock with him to lectures and interviews claiming he brought the stone back from the 
edge of our flat Earth!  He would say, with a huge smirk on his face, 
how his boat had fallen over the edge but he was luckily saved by 
hanging onto this rock.  Clearly, treating our flat Earth in this 
tongue-in-cheek way discouraged people from taking the matter seriously. Ferrari's entire schtick involved approaching the flat Earth subject 
from every angle EXCEPT the rational and scientific (just like Mark Sargent).  For example, he 
published a series of articles including ""The Global Fallacy as a Cause 
of Racial Prejudice,"" arguing that people in countries at the top of the
 globe felt superior to those at the bottom, when in fact there was no 
top or bottom to the world, so, ""even if one assumed that the world was 
spherical, the 'top' and 'bottom' have been arbitrarily selected, 
resulting in racial discrimination against those in the south.  How can 
the globularists, their hirelings and dupes, seriously claim to believe 
that all men are created equal when they teach that some men are 
eternally fated to hang like bats from the bottom of a globe on which 
other men stand upright?  The only solution is a flat Earth!""  So 
instead of presenting measurements or experiments, instead of presenting
 any proofs or evidence, Ferrari would often simply argue the flat Earth
 as a serendipitous satirical solution to social problems. Though he passed away in 2010, his Flat Earth Society still exists 
today online as a website/forum which, still true to form, now run by Daniel Shenton and Co., purports 
several false flat-Earth arguments and treats the entire subject as a 
dead-pan joke.  A Google search for any Flat Earth related subject will bring you top results for several threads from the FES forum; a quick glance at which will show you that FES is where legitimate flat Earth questions go to die.  The board is awash with convex, concave and flat Earth shills ready to pounce upon all new members and turn them off as quickly as possible.  Their laughable ""podcast"" section has only 4 broadcasts, 2 about science-fiction and 2 about the ""hollow Earth"" - none even touch on the subject of evidence/proof of our flat Earth. , several of their administrators and moderators joined up, praised me for my work, nominated me as joint "" ,"" and in a last ditch attempt to co-opt me and my work, asked if we could merge our forums as one!  I was more than willing, but unfortunately has turned out to be shillspicious in many ways. When someone sent him my documentary in November 2014, Matt immediately contacted me and invited me to skype several times.  We had a couple calls but he did 95% of the talking, interrupted me often, and recorded some calls without informing me first.  He seemed a bit off, but I chalked it up to his eccentricity and still figured he was genuine listening to him discuss his commissioned art/murals, and his concern about shills infiltrating the flat Earth movement, among whom he listed Mark Sargent, the FES, Zhib Rhan, Steven Christ, and Lori Frary - all people I had also suspected. Next Matt released his ""Crazy Notion"" video where he is suddenly chatting with top shill Mark Sargent like old friends and presenting his ""revelation"" (which is actually pure speculation, but he adamantly states as fact) that the Earth plane is infinite with no dome and there are many other flat Earth systems beyond the Antarctic ice.  I admit this is a plausible theory, as is Mark's enclosed model theory, but the disingenuous problem here is that Matt nor Mark treat/express these theories as theories but as gospel truth.  Matt also included in his video a series of failed skype calls between he and I, which he did not inform me he was recording, and which dropped every few seconds/minutes due to connection problems.  Instead of editing this out, or chalking it up to normal connection problems, Matt instead left all the dropped calls and claimed in paranoid rants between each one how ""they"" don't want us flat Earthers connecting so ""they"" were causing each call to be dropped. Searching through Matt's older videos on his channel it's clear that such paranoid, aggressive, off-putting rants are part of his schtick and the ""flat Earth"" subject is more of an aside to his other performance pieces.  His YouTube ""TheNASAChannel"" is far less concerned with exposing NASA or the truth of our flat Earth and more concerned with Matt in his latest video.  He always points fingers at the Jesuits for the ""global"" conspiracy, but hammered the final nail in his shilly coffin when he , claiming anyone (like myself) who points the finger at Jews/Judaism as being in any way behind this deception to be a dis-informant!  I have shown in my Flat Earth Conspiracy book beyond any shadow of a doubt that world Freemasonry has been responsible for this global deception, and a simple Google search of ""Judaism and Freemasonry"" will satisfy anyone of the fact that world Freemasonry is 100% beholden to, originating from, and maintained by world Jewry. If all this isn't condemning enough, now Matt is asking all new Facebook friends for 3 pictures allegedly "" ,"" which reminds me of Mark (disable my video comments, but here's my home phone number) Sargent's admission to working as an ""internet data miner for 3 years,"" and Acenci's daily job of harassing IFERS members to register for one of his so that he could produce a book which would expose ""The Greatest Hoax Ever Sold"" - a book like the one I'd just published 5 months prior - without donations.  Next Jeranism suspiciously Giving him the benefit of the doubt, however, I noticed several of his newer videos were quite good and got word of his idea to record a laser experiment to disprove the Earth's supposed curvature.  Jeran set up a second donation page, , where he began taking donations not only for his flat Earth experiment ""wish-list"" including not only a telescope, laser, computer software/hardware, but also the kicker, to help pay off the mortgage on his house!  Once others had already donated his telescope and laser, Being the enthusiastic flat Earth missionary I am, seeing what I'd hoped was another genuine truther in need, and hearing him assure us in the video that he would complete successful test runs before hiring the videographer, I decided to donate the entire $200 to Jeran.  Right around this time he finally joined IFERS, and saying he ""owed Eric Dubay a lot for allowing me to open my mind to the point that 
is needed to see the deception that currently plagues the world.""  This was quite strange considering he'd never contacted me or joined my forum before now, admitted to having never read a single page of the forum, and yet he was already registered and posting on two of my sworn enemy Acenci's shill forums! .  As you can see, even after re-posting all the evidence I've compiled of Mark's lies and misinformation, Jeran still decides to side with Mark and further condemns IFERS for our strict policy of shill-banning.  Soon IFERS members started .  A website named JeranCampanella.com was created by a man accusing Jeran of scamming, extortion, blackmail, and personal defamation!  Upon receiving word of what we had dug up on IFERS, Jeran completely flipped out and you can read his As for the laser video, due to poor planning and NOT completing a successful test prior to hiring the videographer, Jeran ended up having to pay for a second day of filming, only to find that his laser dispersed into a 10 foot beam across the ocean completely nullifying the results! talking with his best buddy Mark Sargent acting like the laser experiment was some big success and trying to spin his side of the IFERS drama referenced above.  He was also admitting that, ""even though my profile logo shows a flat Earth map, I'm not actually 100% a flat Earther, I'm just 100% sure the Earth is not a ball.""  Once again, a supposed ""leading"" flat Earther stating on radio interviews that they're not even sure of their own model! and by top shill Mark Sargent in literally every single interview he gives.  Crow's entire channel and every interview is dedicated to his claim that a digital wavy-line filmed with his high-tech cameras proves that the Moon is not a natural luminary, but rather a holographic projection!  This is just like how 
David Icke says a bunch of great stuff then writes a whole book saying 
""the Moon is a hollow space-ship piloted by reptilian aliens who control
 humanity with mind-control moon-beams.""  These agents purposely poison the well
 and muddy the waters to obfuscate the truth, which is that to have psychopathic tendencies himself.  Once the flat Earth topic started gaining traction Thomas began putting out videos claiming that everyone promoting the Flat Earth topic was part of a over the fact that people could be so stupid as to consider the flat Earth subject.  He even considers ceasing all his YouTube/radio activity due to his utter dismay, but then gets over his depression quite quickly and continues on. is the Aussie truther responsible for the Crowhouse and Surviving the Matrix radio, who long supported my work ( where he disparaged my work on the flat Earth without actually reading any of it (and refusing to waste his time).  Then, just like Thomas Sheridan, he claimed to go into a deep depression after talking with me and considered ceasing all his activism!  But as , he found an inspiring quote the next day and decided to continue on and completely ignore the flat Earth truth. (the title of MY book and documentary), AND THEN BANNED ME FROM IT.  After successfully co-opting my keywords, she claimed to be purging her group of ""anti-semitic"" posters, and even though I hadn't posted anything but my FE articles/videos, .  Linking the ball Earth deception to the Jews question is something Matt, Mark, Lori, Jeran and the other shills seem desperate to avoid. is another active Facebook shill who who joined IFERS as ""SyntasticSugar.com"" which is his website.  He also 
started a ""Flat Earth Wiki"" site and hounded me for weeks to 
contribute to it when he hadn't yet contributed anything to it himself.  He 
finally made a couple paragraphs about the Bedford Level, promoted it all over Facebook like it was some great accomplishment, then 
further pleaded to get me and others to contribute to his Flat Earth Wiki which I 
just didn't have time for, and it looked like he didn't either by the 
state of it (much like Lori's lazily made, never updated FlatEarthConspiracy.com)  Next, Thai friends of mine (who have nothing to do with flat Earth) started contacting me asking ""who's Steven?"" saying he was trying to add them on Facebook.  When I confronted him about this apparent data-mining attempt, , Steven claimed to be adding ""anyone talking about the flat Earth,"" which is a complete lie as the people who he was adding from my friends list have NEVER posted about the flat Earth is a YouTuber who makes horribly boring and uninformative flat Earth videos mixed with Crow-style ""hologram Moon"" bullshit and Zhib-style ""Jesus is the only truth"" rants.  Upon joining IFERS I gave him is a YouTuber and blogger who joined IFERS and posted nothing but huge, convoluted, long-winded,
 semi-relevant copy/pastes from his blogs into several threads, and , and asked to write with greater clarity and 
simplicity so we could understand him, he refused and was thus banned. After his banishment he began , how offended he is, and turning his banishment into a huge soap 
opera drama where he falsely claims he was ""harassed, assaulted, bullied, beaten, 
harmed, injured, mentally abused"" and my favorite, ""gang-stalked"" by us, claiming we committed ""violence"" against him which he's psychologically venting by making endless videos with flat Earth keywords.  There is a sub-class of shills like DaveJ and Rayn Gryphon who seem to 
be paid simply to post as many videos as possible with flat 
Earth-related keywords to muddy the waters with a bunch of terrible and 
non-sensical videos.  Other examples of this are Alien Fossil Project, Queenie Cameron, and NatureHacker. is a YouTuber and blogger who has recently created a series of videos attempting to debunk me while (much like Lori Frary) co-opting my name to do so.  His series, ""The Flat Earth Conspiracy 2015"" is quite pathetic and laughable, but successfully hijacks my keywords.  You can read There are certainly many more shills out there and many more arriving on the scene presently.  Everyone be sure to do your due diligence and stay vigilant in discerning your way through the intentionally muddied waters of the flat Earth truth movement!  If you have any more evidence of shills I have listed or missed please leave a comment below."
55,NASA's Huge Balls Exposed,"For thousands of years the ""planets"" were known as ""wandering stars"" as they differ from the fixed stars in their relative motions only.  Through a telescope both the fixed stars and wandering ""planets"" appear as nothing more than tiny round dots of light, luminaries, circling the night sky.  They do NOT appear in any way to be spherical Earth-like terra firma balls capable of landing on as the Freemasons at NASA would have us believe with their fake CGI pictures and videos.  The following video exposes the entire deception proving that Earth is in fact a plane and ""planets"" do not exist!  They just added a ""T"" and you fell for it."
56,The Flat-Earth Conspiracy Challenge,"by Eric Dubay which is literally re-shaping the world and spear-heading a mass awakening to the greatest conspiracy and most successful cover-up in history.  Ancient civilizations the world over , which reigned undisputed for
thousands of years adequately explaining all Earthly and celestial phenomena, was
violently uprooted, spun around, and sent flying through infinite space by a
cabal of Sun-worshipping theoretical astronomers. , have succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick up the fixed Earth, shape it
into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! In schools where every professor’s desk is adorned
with a spinning Earth-globe, we are lectured on the “heliocentric” theory of
the universe, shown images of The illusion created, connivingly convincing,

ever keep a lid on the wicked lie with the internet so instant...... OMG Eric!!!! I'm camping in the mountains this week 
and won't be back in Melbourne till end of week.... I'm reading your 
book!!!! I'm having the paradigm shift of all paradigm shifts!!!! This 
has to be THE LIE OF ALL LIES....I suggest that this heliocentric

 everything, is based upon it. You truly are a wonderful man to have 
brought this lie to our attention.... and in such a creative and 
artistic way.  Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!! XXXOOO""  -Vicki Victoria ""HI
 Eric, Great job! I read your book, then ordered, and am reading,

inspiring and appreciated.  IMHO, Eric is doing a great service to 
Mankind.  I successfully worked on Wall Street for over 20 years and met
 many 
brilliant men and women, who only cared about the paychecks.  Eric
 has done some very heavy lifting for the greater good of all. His 
analysis is empirical and plain, look for yourself, common sense.  I
 for one have learned a great deal from his deep research and 
independent inquiry. And from other comments show so are many other 
inquiring
 minds.""  - ""HI
 Guys. Just finished reading The Flat Earth book by Eric. Very 
interesting. The Math adds up. I am well aware of the laws of 
perspective. I have worked in civil engineering. I have flown at various
 heights as a civilian and as military personnel and have often thought 
that the curvature of the earth isn't that curved at all. I have not 
considered the 'no dinosaur stance' though. However, I am reasonably 
well read on our giant ancestry, the Smithsonian cover up and the many 
reports of findings around the world of bones and other artifacts. I 
really enjoyed reading this book and would welcome any other suggestions
 with regard to advancing my knowledge base. I am going to put the 
Atlantean Conspiracy on my future reading list. I have sent for 
Spiritual Science as a next read.""   -Ivan Mayland ""I just spent a whole day reading the book and i'm 
quite freaked out. It's going to take a little while to even start to 
digest this. I was battling a degree of cognitive dissonance to begin 
with but you're quite overwhelmingly and exhaustively convincing and 
thorough. Until now, not one bit of potential esoteric info has 
particularly surprised or bothered me. I'd be mildly bemused if 
Elizabeth Windsor started shape-shifting into a reptilian live on tv but I'd be fairly nonchalant about it and probably enjoy saying 'I told you
 so...' to a few people. All of the esoteric stuff so far has
 been about expansion.  But what you're saying 
seemingly brings everything back to a place where we're the center of 
all creation/the universe. I'm really struggling with this!  I think I'll go back and read your other books next to get some more perspective.""  -Jordan Rose ""I just finished your book. It answered a few 
lingering questions I had. The literature on the sun/moon and the number
 13 stood out to me personally. The shocking thing is 
it is exactly what I need my mom to read. She read the Atlantean 
Conspiracy and has some issues she can't wrap her catholic/scientific 
mind around. Your books are phenomenal for hitting a particular target 
audience... from the conspiracy theorists,  religious groups, science, 
and so on. You have a way of showing each group the same story. Spiritual Science capitalized on quantum physics,  this most recent book will 
definitely target devout bible people (don't know what else to call 
them) and with the pope's recent comments I am sure a lot of religious 
people will begin to wonder why is the Vatican changing suddenly.  They 
may start looking like I did. And I am sure some of them will find your 
book. It is working be patient and don't stop writing!""  -Lauren Peters ""Hi Eric, I really love the book 
  you should be very proud at collating so much information together 
that creates a great argument against what is a MASSIVE 
BELIEF.... heheh.... love it! Large respect to Eric Dubay from The Atlantean Conspiracy, who during my
 research kindly sent me a copy of his new book to preview - he covers a
 ton of information and amazing images in near 300 pages, collaborating 
years of intense research."
57,The Measurable Non-Curvature of the Flat Earth,"25,000 statute miles in equatorial circumference with a curvature of 7.935
inches to the mile, varying inversely as the square of the distance, meaning in
3 miles there is a declination of nearly 6 feet, in 30 miles 600 feet, in 300
miles 60,000 feet and so on. Therefore,
if we wish to prove or disprove the validity of their convexity claim, it is a
fairly simple, straight-forward matter of For example, the distance across the Irish Sea from the Isle of Man’s
Douglas Harbor to Great Orm’s Head in North Wales is 60 miles. If the Earth was a globe then the surface of
the water between them would form a 60 mile arc, the center towering 1944 feet
higher than the coastlines at either end! It is well-known and easily verifiable, however, that on a clear day,
from a modest altitude of 100 feet, the Great Orm’s Head is visible from
Douglas Harbor. Assuming
the 100 foot altitude causes the horizon to appear approximately 13 miles off,
the 47 miles remaining means the Welsh coastline should still fall an
impossible 1472 feet below the line of sight! In the Times newspaper of Monday, Oct. 16, 1854, in an
account of her Majesty’s visit to Great Grimsby from Hull, the following
paragraph occurs: ‘Their attention was first naturally directed to a gigantic
tower which rises from the center pier to the height of 300 feet, and can be
seen 60 miles out at sea.’ The 60 miles
if nautical, and this is always understood when referring to distances at sea,
would make 70 statute miles, to which the fall of 8 inches belongs, and as all
observations at sea are considered to be made at an elevation of 10 feet above
the water, for which four miles must be deducted from the whole distance, 66
statute miles will remain, the square of which multiplied by 8 inches, gives a
declination towards the tower of 2,904 feet; deducting from this the altitude
of the tower, 300 feet, we obtain the startling conclusion that the tower
should be at the distance at which it is visible, more than 2,600 feet below
the horizon! Indoctrinated naysayers will often retort that light
refraction off the water’s surface could account for such phenomena. To begin with, the idea that we cannot
differentiate between the refracted light of something and the thing itself is
preposterous, but even assuming we couldn’t, surveyors’ general allowance for
refraction is only 1/12th the altitude of the object observed, making it a
completely implausible explanation. Using the previous example of 2,600 feet divided by 12 gives 206, which
subtracted from 2,600 leaves 2,384 feet that the tower should have remained
below the horizon. In September, 1898, I received a letter from Australia
in which the writer says: ‘In the year 1872 I was on board the ship ‘Thomas
Wood,’ Capt. Gibson from China to London. Owing to making a long passage, we ran short of provisions, and so short
after rounding the Cape that the Captain spoke of putting into St. Helena for a
supply. It was then my hobby to get the
first glimpse of land, make a survey, just as the sun would be rising. St. Helena is a high volcanic island, and if
my informant had seen the top only, there would have to be an allowance made
for the height of the land, but as he sketched the island he must have seen the
whole of it, which should have been 3,650 feet below the line of sight, if the
world be a globe In Chambers’ Journal, February 1895, a sailor near Mauritius
in the Indian Ocean reported having seen a vessel which turned out to be an
incredible 200 miles away! The incident
caused much heated debate in nautical circles at the time, gaining further
confirmation in Aden, Yemen where another witness reported seeing a missing Bombay
steamer from 200 miles away. He
correctly stated the precise appearance, location and direction of the steamer
all later corroborated and confirmed correct by those onboard. Such sightings are absolutely inexplicable if
the Earth were actually a ball 25,000 miles around, as ships 200 miles distant would
have to be well over 4 miles below the line of 
 
 
sight! Astronomers are in the habit of considering two points
on the Earth's surface, without, it seems, any limit as to the distance that
lies between them, as being on a level, and the intervening section, even though
it be an ocean, as a vast ‘hill’ - of water! The Atlantic ocean, in taking this view of the
matter, would form a ‘hill of water’ more than a hundred miles high! The idea
is simply monstrous, and could only be entertained by scientists whose whole
business is made up of materials of the same description: and it certainly
requires no argument to deduce, from such ‘science’ as this, a satisfactory
proof that the Earth is not a globe. Every man in full command of his senses knows that a level surface is a
flat or horizontal one; but astronomers tell us that the true level is the
curved surface of a globe! They know that man requires a level surface on which
to live, so they give him one in name which is not one in fact! This is the
best that astronomers, with their theoretical science, can do for their fellow
creatures - deceive them. Vast areas exhibit a perfectly dead level, scarcely a rise
existing through 1,500 miles from the Carpathians to the Urals. South of the Baltic the country is so flat
that a prevailing north wind will drive the waters of the Stattiner Haf into
the mouth of the Oder, and give the river a backward flow 30 or 40 miles. The plains of Venezuela and New Granada, in
South America chiefly on the left of the Orinoco, are termed Ilanos, or level
fields. The Amazon only falls 12 feet in the last 700
miles of its course; the La Plata has only a descent of one thirty-third of an
inch a mile These extracts clearly prove that the surface of the
earth is level, and that therefore the world is not a globe. And when we come to consider the surface of
the world under the sea, we shall find the same uniformity of evidence against
the popular view. In ‘Nature and Man,’
by Professor W.B. Carpenter, article ‘The Deep Sea and its Contents,’ the
writer says: ‘If the bottom of the
mid-ocean were laid dry, an observer standing on any spot of it would find
himself surrounded BY A PLAIN, only comparable to that of the North American prairies
or the South American pampas … The form of the depressed area which lodges the
water of the deep ocean is rather, indeed, to be likened to that of a FLAT
WAITER or TEA TRAY, surrounded by an elevated and deeply sloping rim, than to
that of the basin with which it is commonly compared.’ This remarkable writer tells of thousands of
miles, in the Atlantic, the Pacific, and the great Southern Ocean beds being a
plane surface, and from his remarks it is clear that A FLAT SURFACE IS THE
GENERAL CONTOUR OF THE BED OF THE GREAT OCEANS FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF SQUARE
MILES"
58,Space Travel is the Hoax of the Century!,", the International Space Station, the Hubble space telescope, satellites, and sustained space travel in general are absolutely the biggest hoaxes of the century, and NASA the most successful propaganda organization in history. The International Space Station, just like everything else brought to us by NASA, is a fake Freemasonic hoax, a complete fabrication done with special effects, models, pools, zero G planes, and various camera tricks.  The above video exposes key points of evidence for the hoax and breaks down exactly how the illusion is created and maintained. Satellites are purely science-fiction.  All supposed images of satellites in orbit show fake CGI ""satellites"" orbiting a First conceived by Freemason science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke in 1945,  they claim satellites became science-fact soon after.  This is impossible for many reasons outlined in the above video, however, including the fact the melting points of the metals used in satellites are far lower than the temperature in the ""thermosphere"" where satellites supposedly are.  And lastly, for a few extra laughs at NASA's expense for once, see the following NASA Fail Compilation:"

61,NASA Fail Compilation,"NASA Fails so hard and so often they cannot be taken seriously by earnest truth-seekers.  This band of incessantly lying Freemasons and Nazis have completely deceived the world into believing their astro-nots have landed on the Moon and Mars, that space stations and satellites are constantly suspended in ""geosynchronous"" orbit with the Earth, an Earth which they claim is revolving around the Sun and shooting through infinite space away from a Big Bang creationary sneeze at 670,000,000mph.  NASA has also ""confirmed"" the existence of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (one septillion) other ball planets, where many of life MUST exist.  The amount of science-fiction and fantasy peddled by this group of supposed ""scientists,"" and believed as gospel truth by the vast majority of the population, puts all the imaginings of George Lucas and Gene Roddenberry to shame.  Thanks to a bit of rocket technology, Zero G planes, wires, cranes, pools, sound studios and all the lying Freemasons they need, NASA has successfully fooled the entire world out of believing their own eyes and experience,"
62,The Flat-Earth Conspiracy,"We have been taught that the
height of stupidity and naivety was when our ignorant ancestors believed the
Earth to be flat, and that if any man somehow still thinks the Earth to be the
immovable center of the universe, that they must be the most primitive kind of
ignoramus. Nowadays the label “Flat-Earther” has become literally
synonymous with “moron” and is a common cliché derogatory term for insulting
someone’s intelligence. Upon seeing a
book titled “The Flat Earth Conspiracy” your ingrained instinct is likely to
laugh, mock the messenger, and deny the very possibility.  The fact of the matter is however, that everything is actually just as it appears.  The Earth is flat and motionless just as it seems, the Sun/Moon are the same size, and all the celestial bodies revolve around us.  This stable geocentric universe, proven true by experience
and experiments, which reigned undisputed for thousands of years adequately
explaining all Earthly and celestial phenomena, was violently uprooted, spun
around, and sent flying through infinite space by a cabal of Sun-worshipping
theoretical astronomers. Early Masonic
magicians like Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, along with their modern
Masonic astro-not counter-parts like Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins,
hand-in-hand with NASA and world Freemasonry have pulled off the greatest hoax,
propagated the most phenomenal lie, and perpetuated the most complete
indoctrination in history. Over the course of 500 years, using everything from books, magazines,
and television to computer-generated imaging, a multi-generational conspiracy
has succeeded, in the minds of the masses, to pick up the fixed Earth, shape it
into a ball, spin it in circles, and throw it around the Sun! In schools where every professor’s desk is adorned
with a spinning Earth-globe, we are lectured on the “heliocentric” theory of
the universe, shown images of ball-planets and videos of men suspended in space. The illusion created, connivingly convincing,
has entranced the world’s population into blindly believing a maleficent
myth. The greatest cover-up of all time,
NASA and Freemasonry’s biggest secret, is that we are living on a plane, not a
planet, that Earth is the flat, stationary center of the universe.  My new book, ""The Flat-Earth Conspiracy"" exposes the entire deception, please help support independent media and purchase"
